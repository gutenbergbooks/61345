<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Many books are dry and dusty, there is no juice
in them; and many are soon exhausted, you would
no more go back to them than to a squeezed orange;
but some have in them an unfailing sap, both from
the tree of knowledge and from the tree of life.</p>

<p>By companionable books I mean those that are
worth taking with you on a journey, where the
weight of luggage counts, or keeping beside your
bed, near the night-lamp; books that will bear reading
often, and the more slowly you read them the
better you enjoy them; books that not only tell you
how things look and how people behave, but also
interpret nature and life to you, in language of
beauty and power touched with the personality of
the author, so that they have a real voice audible to
your spirit in the silence.</p>

<p>Here I have written about a few of these books
which have borne me good company, in one way
or another,—and about their authors, who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
put the best of themselves into their work. Such
criticism as the volume contains is therefore mainly
in the form of appreciation with reasons for it. The
other kind of criticism you will find chiefly in the
omissions.</p>

<p>So (changing the figure to suit this cabin by the
sea) I send forth my new ship, hoping only that it
may carry something desirable from each of the
ports where it has taken on cargo, and that it may
not be sunk by the enemy before it touches at a
few friendly harbours.</p>

<p>There was once an Eastern prince who was much
enamoured of the art of gardening. He wished that
all flowers delightful to the eye, and all fruits pleasant
to the taste and good for food, should grow in
his dominion, and that in growing the flowers should
become more fair, the fruits more savoury and nourishing.
With this thought in his mind and this desire
in his heart, he found his way to the Ancient
One, the Worker of Wonders who dwells in a secret
place, and made known his request.</p>

<p>“For the care of your gardens and your orchards,”
said the Ancient One, “I can do nothing, since that
charge has been given to you and to your people.
Nor will I send blossoming plants and fruiting trees
of every kind to make your kingdom rich and beautiful
as by magic, lest the honour of labour should be
diminished, and the slow reward of patience despised,
and even the living gifts bestowed upon you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
without toil should wither and die away. But this
will I do: a single tree shall be brought to you from
a far country by the hands of my servants, and you
shall plant it in the midst of your land. In the
body of that tree is the sap of life that was from the
beginning; the leaves of it are full of healing; its
flowers never fail, and its fruitage is the joy of every
season. The roots of the tree shall go down to the
springs of deep waters; and wherever its pollen is
drifted by the wind or borne by the bees, the gardens
shall put on new beauty; and wherever its seed
is carried by the fowls of the air, the orchards shall
yield a richer harvest. But the tree itself you shall
guard and cherish and keep as I give it you, neither
cutting anything away from it, nor grafting anything
upon it; for the life of the tree is in all the
branches, and the other trees shall be glad because
of it.”</p>

<p>As the Ancient One had spoken, so it came to
pass. The land of that prince had great renown of
fine flowers and delicious fruits, ever unfolding in
new colours and sweeter flavours the life that was
shed among them by the tree of trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Something like the marvel of this tale may be
read in the history of the Bible. No other book in
the world has had such a strange vitality, such an
outgoing power of influence and inspiration. Not
only has it brought to the countries in whose heart
it has been set new ideals of civilization, new models
of character, new conceptions of virtue and hopes of
happiness; but it has also given new impulse and
form to the shaping imagination of man, and begotten
beauty in literature and the other arts.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that it were possible to dissolve
away all the works of art which clearly owe
their being to thoughts, emotions, or visions derived
from the Bible,—all sculpture like Donatello’s
“David” and Michelangelo’s “Moses”; all painting
like Raphael’s “Sistine Madonna” and Murillo’s
“Holy Family”; all music like Bach’s “Passion”
and Handel’s “Messiah”; all poetry like Dante’s
“Divine Comedy” and Milton’s “Paradise Lost,”—how
it would impoverish the world!</p>

<p>The literary influence of the Bible appears the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
more wonderful when we consider that it is the
work of a race not otherwise potent or famous in
literature. We do not know, of course, what other
books may have come from the Jewish nation and
vanished with whatever of power or beauty they
possessed; but in those that remain there is little of
exceptional force or charm for readers outside of the
Hebrew race. They have no broad human appeal,
no universal significance, not even any signal excellence
of form and imagery. Josephus is a fairly
good historian, sometimes entertaining, but not
comparable to Herodotus or Thucydides or Tacitus
or Gibbon. The Talmuds are vast storehouses of
things new and old, where a careful searcher may
now and then find a legendary gem or a quaint
fragment of moral tapestry. In histories of mediæval
literature, Ibn Ezra of Toledo and Rashi of
Lunel are spoken of with respect. In modern letters,
works as far apart as the philosophical treatises
of Spinoza and the lyrics of Heinrich Heine have
distinction in their kind. No one thinks that the
Hebrews are lacking in great and varied talents;
but how is it that in world-literature their only contribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that counts is the Bible? And how is it
that it counts so immensely?</p>

<p>It is possible to answer by saying that in the Old
Testament we have a happily made collection of the
best things in the ancient literature of the Jews, and
in the New Testament we have another anthology
of the finest of the narratives and letters which were
produced by certain writers of the same race under
a new and exceedingly powerful spiritual impulse.
The Bible is excellent because it contains the cream
of Hebrew thought. But this answer explains nothing.
It only restates the facts in another form.
How did the cream rise? How did such a collection
come to be made? What gives it unity and coherence
underneath all its diversity? How is it that,
as a clear critic has well said, “These sixty books,
with all their varieties of age, authorship, literary
form, are, when properly arranged, felt to draw together
with a unity like the connectedness of a dramatic
plot?”</p>

<p>There is an answer, which if it be accepted, carries
with it a solution of the problem.</p>

<p>Suppose a race chosen by some process of selection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
(which need not now be discussed or defined)
to develop in its strongest and most absolute form
that one of man’s faculties which is called the religious
sense, to receive most clearly and deeply the
impression of the unity, spirituality, and righteousness
of a Supreme Being present in the world. Imagine
that race moving through a long and varied
experience under this powerful impression, now
loyal to it, now rebelling against it, now misinterpreting
it, now led by the voice of some prophet to
understand it more fully and feel it more profoundly,
but never wholly losing it for a single generation.
Imagine the history of that race, its poetry,
the biography of its famous men and women,
the messages of its moral reformers, conceived and
written in constant relation to that strongest factor
of conscious life, the sense of the presence and power
of the Eternal.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, in a time of darkness and humiliation,
that there rises within that race a prophet who
declares that a new era of spiritual light has come,
preaches a new revelation of the Eternal, and claims
in his own person to fulfil the ancient hopes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
promises of a divine deliverer and redeemer. Imagine
his followers, few in number, accepting his
message slowly and dimly at first, guided by companionship
with him into a clearer understanding
and a stronger belief, until at last they are convinced
that his claims are true, and that he is the saviour
not only of the chosen people, but also of the whole
world, the revealer of the Eternal to mankind.
Imagine these disciples setting out with incredible
courage to carry this message to all nations, so
deeply impressed with its truth that they are supremely
happy to suffer and die for it, so filled with
the passion of its meaning that they dare attempt
to remodel the life of the world with it. Suppose a
human story like this underneath the writing of the
books which are gathered in the Bible, and you
have an explanation—it seems to me the only reasonable
explanation—of their surpassing quality and
their strange unity.</p>

<p>This story is not a mere supposition: its general
outline, stated in these terms, belongs to the realm
of facts which cannot reasonably be questioned.
What more is needed to account for the story itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
what potent and irresistible reality is involved in
this record of experience, I do not now ask. This is
not an estimate of the religious authority of the
Bible, nor of its inspiration in the theological sense
of that word, but only of something less important,
though no less real—its literary influence.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The fountain-head of the power of the Bible in
literature lies in its nearness to the very springs and
sources of human life—life taken seriously, earnestly,
intensely; life in its broadest meaning, including
the inward as well as the outward; life interpreted
in its relation to universal laws and eternal
values. It is this vital quality in the narratives,
the poems, the allegories, the meditations, the discourses,
the letters, gathered in this book, that
gives it first place among the books of the world not
only for currency, but also for greatness.</p>

<p>For the currency of literature depends in the long
run upon the breadth and vividness of its human
appeal. And the greatness of literature depends
upon the intensive significance of those portions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
life which it depicts and interprets. Now, there is
no other book which reflects so many sides and
aspects of human experience as the Bible, and this
fact alone would suffice to give it a world-wide interest
and make it popular. But it mirrors them
all, whether they belong to the chronicles of kings
and conquerors, or to the obscure records of the
lowliest of labourers and sufferers, in the light of a
conviction that they are all related to the will and
purpose of the Eternal. This illuminates every figure
with a divine distinction, and raises every event
to the <i>n</i>th power of meaning. It is this fact that
gives the Bible its extraordinary force as literature
and makes it great.</p>

imagery, the Bible walks the ways of all the world with
familiar feet and enters land after land to find its own
everywhere. It has learned to speak in hundreds of
languages to the heart of man. It comes into the palace
to tell the monarch that he is a servant of the Most
High, and into the cottage to assure the peasant that
he is a son of God. Children listen to its stories with
wonder and delight, and wise men ponder them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
parables of life. It has a word of peace for the time
of peril, a word of comfort for the day of calamity, a
word of light for the hour of darkness. Its oracles are
repeated in the assembly of the people, and its counsels
whispered in the ear of the lonely. The wicked and
the proud tremble at its warning, but to the wounded
and the penitent it has a mother’s voice. The wilderness
and the solitary place have been made glad by it,
and the fire on the hearth has lit the reading of its well-worn
page. It has woven itself into our deepest affections
and coloured our dearest dreams; so that love and
friendship, sympathy and devotion, memory and hope,
put on the beautiful garments of its treasured speech,
breathing of frankincense and myrrh.</i></p>

<p><i>Above the cradle and beside the grave its great words
come to us uncalled. They fill our prayers with power
larger than we know, and the beauty of them lingers
on our ear long after the sermons which they adorned
have been forgotten. They return to us swiftly and
quietly, like doves flying from far away. They surprise
us with new meanings, like springs of water
breaking forth from the mountain beside a long-trodden
path. They grow richer, as pearls do when they are
worn near the heart.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p><i>No man is poor or desolate who has this treasure
for his own. When the landscape darkens and the
trembling pilgrim comes to the Valley named of the
Shadow, he is not afraid to enter: he takes the rod and
staff of Scripture in his hand; he says to friend and
comrade, “Good-by; we shall meet again”; and comforted
by that support, he goes toward the lonely pass
as one who walks through darkness into light.</i></p>

<p>It would be strange indeed if a book which has
played such a part in human life had not exercised
an extraordinary influence upon literature. As a
matter of fact, the Bible has called into existence
tens of thousands of other books devoted to the
exposition of its meaning, the defense and illustration
of its doctrine, the application of its teaching,
or the record of its history. The learned Fabricius,
in the early part of the eighteenth century, published
a <i lang="fr">catalogue raisonné</i> of such books, filling
seven hundred quarto pages.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Since that time the
length of the list has probably more than trebled.
In addition, we must reckon the many books of
hostile criticism and contrary argument which the
Bible has evoked, and which are an evidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
revolt against the might of its influence. All this
tangle of Biblical literature has grown up around it
like a vast wood full of all manner of trees, great
and small, useful and worthless, fruit-trees, timber-trees,
berry-bushes, briers, and poison-vines. But
all of them, even the most beautiful and tall, look
like undergrowth, when we compare them with the
mighty oak of Scripture, towering in perennial
grandeur, the father of the forest.</p>

<p>Among the patristic writers there were some of
great genius like Origen and Chrysostom and Augustine.
The mediæval schools of theology produced
men of philosophic power, like Anselm and
Thomas Aquinas; of spiritual insight, like the author
of the <cite>Imitatio Christi</cite>. The eloquence of France
reached its height in the discourses of Bossuet, Bourdaloue,
and Massillon. German became one of the
potent tongues of literature when Martin Luther
used it in his tracts and sermons, and Herder’s
<cite>Geist der hebräischen Poesie</cite> is one of the great books
in criticism. In English, to mention such names as
Hooker and Fuller and Jeremy Taylor is to recall
the dignity, force, and splendour of prose at its best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Yet none of these authors has produced anything
to rival the book from which they drew their common
inspiration.</p>

<p>In the other camp, though there have been many
brilliant assailants, not one has surpassed, or even
equalled, in the estimation of the world, the literary
excellence of the book which they attacked. The
mordant wit of Voltaire, the lucid and melancholy
charm of Renan, have not availed to drive or draw
the world away from the Bible; and the effect of all
assaults has been to leave it more widely read, better
understood, and more intelligently admired than
ever before.</p>

<p>Now it must be admitted that the same thing is
true, at least in some degree, of other books which
are held to be sacred or quasi-sacred: they are superior
to the distinctively theological literature which
has grown up about them. I suppose nothing of
the Mussulmans is as great as the “Koran,” nothing
of the Hindus as great as the “Vedas”; and
though the effect of the Confucian classics, from
the literary point of view, may not have been altogether
good, their supremacy in the religious library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the Chinese is unquestioned. But the singular
and noteworthy thing about the influence of the
Bible is the extent to which it has permeated general
literature, the mark which it has made in all
forms of belles-lettres. To treat this subject adequately
one would need to write volumes. In this
chapter I can touch but briefly on a few points of
the outline as they come out in English literature.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the Old-English period, the predominant influence
of the Scriptures may be seen in the frequency
with which the men of letters turned to
them for subjects, and in the Biblical colouring and
texture of thought and style. Cædmon’s famous
“Hymn” and the other poems like “Genesis,”
“Exodus,” “Daniel,” and “Judith,” which were
once ascribed to him; Cynewulf’s “Crist,” “The
Fates of the Apostles,” “The Dream of the Rood”;
Ælfric’s “Homilies” and his paraphrases of certain
books of Scripture—these early fruits of our literature
are all the offspring of the Bible.</p>

<p>In the Middle-English period, that anonymous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
masterpiece “Pearl” is full of the spirit of Christian
mysticism, and the two poems called “Cleanness”
and “Patience,” probably written by the same
hand, are free and spirited versions of stories from
the Bible. “The Vision of Piers the Plowman,”
formerly ascribed to William Langland, but now
supposed by some scholars to be the work of four
or five different authors, was the most popular
poem of the latter half of the fourteenth century.
It is a vivid picture of the wrongs and sufferings of
the labouring man, a passionate satire on the corruptions
of the age in church and state, an eloquent
appeal for a return to truth and simplicity. The
feeling and the imagery of Scripture pervade it with
a strange power and charm; in its reverence for
poverty and toil it leans closely and confidently
upon the example of Jesus; and at the end it makes
its ploughman hero appear in some mystic way as
a type, first of the crucified Saviour, and then of the
church which is the body of Christ.</p>

<p>It was about this time, the end of the fourteenth
century, that John Wyclif and his disciples, feeling
the need of the support of the Bible in their work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
as reformers, took up and completed the task of
translating it entirely into the English tongue
of the common people. This rude but vigourous
version was revised and improved by John Purvey.
It rested mainly upon the Latin version of St. Jerome.
At the beginning of the sixteenth century
William Tindale made an independent translation
of the New Testament from the original Greek,
a virile and enduring piece of work, marked by
strength and simplicity, and setting a standard for
subsequent English translations. Coverdale’s version
of the Scriptures was published in 1535, and was
announced as made “out of Douche and Latyn”;
that is to say, it was based upon the German of
Luther and the Zurich Bible, and upon the Vulgate
of St. Jerome; but it owed much to Tindale, to
whose manly force it added a certain music of diction
and grace of phrase which may still be noted
in the Psalms as they are rendered in the Anglican
Prayer-Book. Another translation, marked by accurate
scholarship, was made by English Puritans
at Geneva, and still another, characterized by a
richer Latinized style, was made by English Catholics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
living in exile at Rheims, and was known as
“the Douai Version,” from the fact that it was first
published in its complete form in that city in 1609-1610.</p>

<p>Meantime, in 1604, a company of scholars had
been appointed by King James I in England to
make a new translation “out of the original tongues,
and with the former translations diligently compared
and revised.” These forty-seven men had
the advantage of all the work of their predecessors,
the benefit of all the discussion over doubtful words
and phrases, and the “unearned increment” of
riches which had come into the English language
since the days of Wyclif. The result of their labours,
published in 1611, was the so-called “Authorized
Version,” a monument of English prose in its prime:
clear, strong, direct, yet full of subtle rhythms and
strange colours; now moving as simply as a shepherd’s
song, in the Twenty-third Psalm; now
marching with majestic harmonies, in the book of
Job; now reflecting the lowliest forms of human
life, in the Gospel stories; and now flashing with
celestial splendours in the visions of the Apocalypse;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
vivid without effort; picturesque without exaggeration;
sinewy without strain; capable alike of the
deepest tenderness and the most sublime majesty;
using a vocabulary of only six thousand words to
build a book which, as Macaulay said, “if everything
else in our language should perish, would alone
suffice to show the whole extent of its beauty and
power.”</p>

<p>The literary excellence of this version, no doubt,
did much to increase the influence of the Bible in
literature and confirm its place as the central book
in the life of those who speak and write the English
tongue. Consider a few of the ways in which this
influence may be traced.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>First of all, it has had a general effect upon English
writing, helping to preserve it from the opposite
faults of vulgarity and affectation. Coleridge long
ago remarked upon the tendency of a close study
of the Bible to elevate a writer’s style. There is
a certain naturalness, inevitableness, propriety of
form to substance, in the language of Scripture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
which communicates to its readers a feeling for the
fitness of words; and this in itself is the first requisite
of good writing. Sincerity is the best part
of dignity.</p>

<p>The English of our Bible is singularly free from
the vice of preciosity: it is not far-sought, overnice,
elaborate. Its plainness is a rebuking contrast to
all forms of euphuism. It does not encourage a
direct imitation of itself; for the comparison between
the original and the copy makes the latter
look pale and dull. Even in the age which produced
the authorized version, its style was distinct
and remarkable. As Hallam has observed, it was
“not the English of Daniel, of Raleigh, or Bacon.”
It was something larger, at once more ancient and
more modern, and therefore well fitted to become
not an invariable model, but an enduring standard.
Its words come to it from all sources; they are not
chosen according to the foolish theory that a word
of Anglo-Saxon origin is always stronger and simpler
than a Latin derivative. Take the beginning of
the Forty-sixth Psalm:</p>

<p>“God is our refuge and strength, a very present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though
the earth be removed, and though the mountains
be carried into the midst of the sea; though the
waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
mountains shake with the swelling thereof.”</p>

<p>Or take this passage from the Epistle to the
Romans:</p>

<p>“Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly
love; in honour preferring one another; not
slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the
Lord; rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing
instant in prayer; distributing to the necessity
of saints; given to hospitality.”</p>

<p>Here is a style that adapts itself by instinct to
its subject, and whether it uses Saxon words like
“strength” and “help” and “love” and “hope,” or
Latin words like “refuge” and “trouble” and “present”
and “fervent” and “patient” and “prayer”
and “hospitality,” weaves them into a garment
worthy of the thought.</p>

<p>The literary influence of a great, popular book
written in such a style is both inspiring and conservative.
It survives the passing modes of prose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in each generation, and keeps the present in touch
with the past. It preserves a sense of balance and
proportion in a language whose perils lie in its liberties
and in the indiscriminate use of its growing
wealth. And finally it keeps a medium of communication
open between the learned and the simple; for
the two places where the effect of the Bible upon
the English language may be most clearly felt are
in the natural speech of the plain people and in the
finest passages of great authors.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Following this line of the influence of the Bible
upon language as the medium of literature, we find,
in the next place, that it has contributed to our common
speech a great number of phrases which are
current everywhere. Sometimes these phrases are
used in a merely conventional way. They serve as
counters in a long extemporaneous prayer, or as
padding to a page of dull and pious prose. But at
other times they illuminate the sentence with a new
radiance; they clarify its meaning with a true symbol;
they enhance its value with rich associations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
they are “sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.”</p>

<p>Take for example such phrases as these: “a good
old age,” “the wife of thy bosom,” “the apple of
his eye,” “gathered to his fathers,” “a mother in
Israel,” “a land flowing with milk and honey,” “the
windows of heaven,” “the fountains of the great
deep,” “living fountains of waters,” “the valley of
decision,” “cometh up as a flower,” “a garden enclosed,”
“one little ewe lamb,” “thou art the man,”
“a still, small voice,” “as the sparks fly upward,”
“swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,” “miserable comforters,”
“the strife of tongues,” “the tents of Kedar,”
“the cry of the humble,” “the lofty looks
of man,” “the pride of life,” “from strength to
strength,” “as a dream when one awaketh,” “the
wings of the morning,” “stolen waters,” “a dinner
of herbs,” “apples of gold in pictures of silver,”
“better than rubies,” “a lion in the way,” “vanity
of vanities,” “no discharge in that war,” “the little
foxes that spoil the vines,” “terrible as an army
with banners,” “precept upon precept, line upon
line,” “as a drop of a bucket,” “whose merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
are princes,” “trodden the wine-press alone,” “the
rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley,” “the highways
and hedges,” “the salt of the earth,” “the
burden and heat of the day,” “the signs of the
times,” “a pearl of great price,” “what God hath
joined together,” “the children of light,” “the powers
that be,” “if the trumpet give an uncertain
sound,” “the fashion of this world,” “decently and
in order,” “a thorn in the flesh,” “labour of love,”
“a cloud of witnesses,” “to entertain angels unawares,”
“faithful unto death,” “a crown of life.”
Consider also those expressions which carry with
them distinctly the memory of some ancient story:
“the fleshpots of Egypt,” “manna in the wilderness,”
“a mess of pottage,” “Joseph’s coat,” “the
driving of Jehu,” “the mantle of Elijah,” “the widow’s
mite,” “the elder brother,” “the kiss of Judas,”
“the house of Martha,” “a friend of publicans and
sinners,” “many mansions,” “bearing the cross.”
Into such phrases as these, which are familiar to us
all, the Bible has poured a wealth of meaning far
beyond the measure of the bare words. They call
up visions and reveal mysteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Direct, but not always accurate, quotations from
Scripture and allusions to Biblical characters and
events are very numerous in English literature.
They are found in all sorts of books. Professor
Albert T. Cook has recently counted sixty-three in
a volume of descriptive sketches of Italy, twelve in
a book on wild animals, and eighteen in a novel by
Thomas Hardy. A special study of the Biblical
references in Tennyson has been made,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and more
than five hundred of them have been found.</p>

<p>Bishop Charles Wordsworth has written a book
on <cite>Shakespeare’s Knowledge and Use of the Bible</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and shown “how fully and how accurately the
general tenor of the facts recorded in the sacred
narrative was present to his mind,” and “how Scriptural
are the conceptions which Shakespeare had of
the being and attributes of God, of His general and
particular Providence, of His revelation to man, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
our duty toward Him and toward each other, of
human life and of human death, of time and of
eternity.” It is possible that the bishop benevolently
credits the dramatist with a more invariable
and complete orthodoxy than he possessed. But
certainly Shakespeare knew the Bible well, and felt
the dramatic value of allusions and illustrations
which were sure to be instantly understood by the
plain people. It is his Antonio, in <cite>The Merchant
of Venice</cite>, who remarks that “the Devil can cite
Scripture for his purpose,” evidently referring to the
Gospel story of the evil one who tried to tempt
Jesus with a verse from the Psalms.</p>

<p>The references to the Bible in the poetry of
Robert Browning have been very carefully examined
by Mrs. Machen in an admirable little book.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
It is not too much to say that his work is crowded
with Scriptural quotations, allusions, and imagery.
He follows Antonio’s maxim, and makes his bad
characters, like Bishop Blougram and Sludge the
Medium, cite from Holy Writ to cloak their hypocrisy
or excuse their villainy. In his longest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
poem, <cite>The Ring and the Book</cite>, there are said to be
more than five hundred Biblical references.</p>

<p>But more remarkable even than the extent to
which this material drawn from the Scriptures has
been used by English writers, is the striking effect
which it produces when it is well used. With what
pathos does Sir Walter Scott, in <cite>The Heart of Midlothian</cite>,
make old Davie Deans bow his head when
he sees his daughter Effie on trial for her life, and
mutter to himself, “Ichabod! my glory is departed!”
How magnificently does Ruskin enrich his <cite>Sesame
and Lilies</cite> with that passage from Isaiah in which
the fallen kings of Hades start from their thrones
to greet the newly fallen with the cry, “Art thou
also become weak as we? Art thou become like
unto us?” How grandly do the images and thoughts
of the last chapters of Deuteronomy roll through
Kipling’s <cite>Recessional</cite>, with its Scriptural refrain,
“Lest we forget!”</p>

<p>There are some works of literature in English since
the sixteenth century which are altogether Biblical
in subject and colouring. Chief among these in
prose is <cite>The Pilgrim’s Progress</cite> of John Bunyan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in verse, the <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, <cite>Paradise Regained</cite>, and
<cite>Samson Agonistes</cite> of John Milton. These are already
classics. Some day a place near them will be
given to Browning’s <cite>Saul</cite> and <cite>A Death in the
Desert</cite>; but for that we must wait until their form
has stood the test of time.</p>

<p>In general it may be observed—and the remark
holds good of the works just mentioned—that a
Scriptural story or poem is most likely to succeed
when it takes its theme, directly or by suggestion,
from the Bible, and carries it into a region of imagination,
a border-realm, where the author is free to
work without paraphrase or comparison with the
sacred writers. It is for this reason that both
<cite>Samson Agonistes</cite> and <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> are superior to
<cite>Paradise Regained</cite>.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The largest and most important influence of the
Bible in literature lies beyond all these visible effects
upon language and style and imagery and form. It
comes from the strange power of the book to nourish
and inspire, to mould and guide, the inner life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
man. “<em>It finds me</em>,” said Coleridge; and the word
of the philosopher is one that the plain man can
understand and repeat.</p>

<p>The hunger for happiness which lies in every
human heart can never be satisfied without righteousness;
and the reason why the Bible reaches down
so deep into the breast of man is because it brings
news of a kingdom which <em>is</em> righteousness and peace
and joy in the Holy Spirit. It brings this news not
in the form of a dogma, a definition, a scientific
statement, but in the form of literature, a living
picture of experience, a perfect ideal embodied in a
Character and a Life. And because it does this, it
has inspiration for those who write in the service of
truth and humanity.</p>

<p>The Bible has been the favourite book of those
who were troubled and downtrodden, and of those
who bore the great burden of a great task. New
light has broken forth from it to lead the upward
struggle of mankind from age to age. Men have
come back to it because they could not do without it.
Nor will its influence wane, its radiance be darkened,
unless literature ceases to express the noblest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
human longings, the highest of human hopes,
and mankind forgets all that is now incarnate in
the central figure of the Bible,—the Divine Deliverer.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three ways in which we may read the
Bible.</p>

<p>We may come to it as the divinely inspired rule
of faith and conduct. This is the point of view
from which it appears most precious to religion. It
gives us the word of God to teach us what to believe
and how to live.</p>

<p>We may consider it as a collection of historical
books, written under certain conditions, and reflecting,
in their contents and in their language, the circumstances
in which they were produced. This is
the aspect in which criticism regards the Bible; and
its intellectual interest, as well as its religious value,
is greatly enhanced by a clear vision of the truth
about it from this point of view.</p>

<p>We may study it also as literature. We may see
in it a noble and impassioned interpretation of nature
and life, uttered in language of beauty and sublimity,
touched with the vivid colours of human personality,
and embodied in forms of enduring literary
art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>None of these three ways of studying the Bible is
hostile to the others. On the contrary, they are
helpful to one another, because each of them gives
us knowledge of a real factor in the marvellous influence
of the Bible in the world.</p>

<p>The true lover of the Bible has an interest in all
the elements of its life as an immortal book. He
wishes to discern, and rightly to appreciate, the
method of its history, the spirit of its philosophy,
the significance of its fiction, the power of its eloquence,
and the charm of its poetry. He wishes
this all the more because he finds in it something
which is not in any other book: a vision of God, a
hope for man, and an inspiration to righteousness
which seem to him divine. As the worshipper in
the Temple would observe the art and structure of
the carven beams of cedar and the lily-work on the
tops of the pillars the more attentively because they
beautified the house of his God, so the man who has
a religious faith in the Bible will study more eagerly
and carefully the literary forms of the book in which
the Holy Spirit speaks forever.</p>

<p>It is in this spirit that I wish to consider the poetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
element in the Psalms. The comfort, help, and
guidance that they bring to our spiritual life will
not be diminished, but increased, by a perception of
their exquisite form and finish. If a king sent a
golden cup full of cheering cordial to a weary man,
he might well admire the two-fold bounty of the
royal gift. The beauty of the vessel would make
the draught more grateful and refreshing. And if
the cup were inexhaustible, if it filled itself anew as
often as it touched the lips, then the very shape and
adornment of it would become significant and precious.
It would be an inestimable possession, a
singing goblet, a treasure of life.</p>

<p>John Milton, whose faith in religion was as exalted
as his mastery of the art of poetry was perfect,
has expressed in a single sentence the spirit in
which I would approach the poetic study of the
Book of Psalms: “Not in their divine arguments
alone, but in the very critical art of composition,
the Psalms may be easily made to appear over all
kinds of lyric poetry incomparable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Let us remember at the outset that a considerable
part of the value of the Psalms as poetry will lie beyond
our reach. We cannot precisely measure it,
nor give it full appreciation, simply because we are
dealing with the Psalms only as we have them in
our English Bible. This is a real drawback; and it
is well to understand clearly the two things that we
lose in reading the Psalms in this way.</p>

<p>First, we lose the beauty and the charm of verse.
This is a serious loss. Poetry and verse are not the
same thing, but they are so intimately related that
it is difficult to divide them. Indeed, according to
certain definitions of poetry, it would seem almost
impossible.</p>

<p>Yet who will deny that the Psalms as we have
them in the English Bible are really and truly poetical?</p>

<p>The only way out of this difficulty that I can see
is to distinguish between verse as the formal element
and imaginative emotion as the essential element
in poetry. In the original production of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
poem, it seems to me, it is just to say that the embodiment
in metrical language is a law of art which
must be observed. But in the translation of a poem
(which is a kind of reflection of it in a mirror) the
verse may be lost without altogether losing the
spirit of the poem.</p>

<p>Take an illustration from another art. A statue
has the symmetry of solid form. You can look at
it from all sides, and from every side you can see the
balance and rhythm of the parts. In a photograph
this solidity of form disappears. You see only a
flat surface. But you still recognize it as the
reflection of a statue.</p>

<p>The Psalms were undoubtedly written, in the
original Hebrew, according to a system of versification,
and perhaps to some extent with forms of
rhyme.</p>

<p>The older scholars, like Lowth and Herder, held
that such a system existed, but could not be recovered.
Later scholars, like Ewald, evolved a system
of their own. Modern scholarship, represented by
such authors as Professors Cheyne and Briggs, is reconstructing
and explaining more accurately the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Hebrew versification. But, for the present at least,
the only thing that is clear is that this system must
remain obscure to us. It cannot be reproduced in
English. The metrical versions of the Psalms are
the least satisfactory. The poet Cowley said of
them, “They are so far from doing justice to David
that methinks they revile him worse than Shimei.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
We must learn to appreciate the poetry in the
Psalms without the aid of those symmetries of form
and sound in which they first appeared. This is a
serious loss. Poetry without verse is like a bride
without a bridal garment.</p>

<p>The second thing that we lose in reading the
Psalms in English is something even more important.
It is the heavy tax on the wealth of its meaning,
which all poetry must pay when it is imported
from one country to another, through the medium
of translation.</p>

<p>The most subtle charm of poetry is its suggestiveness;
and much of this comes from the magical
power which words acquire over memory and imagination,
from their associations. This intimate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
personal charm must be left behind when a poem
passes from one language to another. The accompaniment,
the harmony of things remembered and
beloved, which the very words of the song once
awakened, is silent now. Nothing remains but the
naked melody of thought. If this is pure and
strong, it will gather new associations; as, indeed,
the Psalms have already done in English, so that
their familiar expressions have become charged with
musical potency. And yet I suppose such phrases
as “a tree planted by the rivers of water,” “a fruitful
vine in the innermost parts of the house,” “the
mountains round about Jerusalem,” can never bring
to us the full sense of beauty, the enlargement of
heart, that they gave to the ancient Hebrews. But,
in spite of this double loss, in the passage from verse
to prose and from Hebrew to English, the poetry in
the Psalms is so real and vital and imperishable that
every reader feels its beauty and power.</p>

<p>It retains one valuable element of poetic form.
This is that balancing of the parts of a sentence, one
against another, to which Bishop Lowth first gave
the familiar name of “parallelism.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
this simple artifice, learned from Nature herself, is
singularly pleasant and powerful. It is the rise and
fall of the fountain, the ebb and flow of the tide,
the tone and overtone of the chiming bell. The
two-fold utterance seems to bear the thought onward
like the wings of a bird. A German writer
compares it very exquisitely to “the heaving and
sinking of the troubled heart.”</p>

<p>It is this “parallelism” which gives such a familiar
charm to the language of the Psalms. Unconsciously,
and without recognizing the nature of the
attraction, we grow used to the double cadence, the
sound and the echo, and learn to look for its recurrence
with delight.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If we should want a plain English name for this
method of composition we might call it <em>thought-rhyme</em>.
It is easy to find varied illustrations of its
beauty and of its power to emphasize large and
simple ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Take for instance that very perfect psalm with
which the book begins—a poem so complete, so
compact, so delicately wrought that it seems like a
sonnet. The subject is <cite>The Two Paths</cite>.</p>

<p>The first part describes the way of the good man.
It has three divisions.</p>

<p>The first verse gives a description of his conduct
by negatives—telling us what he does not do. There
is a triple thought-rhyme here.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor standeth in the way of sinners,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The second verse describes his character positively,
with a double thought-rhyme.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But his delight is in the law of the Lord;</div>
<div class="verse">And in his law doth he meditate day and night.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The third verse tells us the result of this character
and conduct, in a fourfold thought-rhyme.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water:</div>
<div class="verse">That bringeth forth his fruit in his season:</div>
<div class="verse">His leaf also shall not wither:</div>
<div class="verse">And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The second part of the psalm describes the way of
the evil man. In the fourth verse there is a double
thought-rhyme.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The ungodly are not so:</div>
<div class="verse">But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the fifth verse the consequences of this worthless,
fruitless, unrooted life are shown, again with
a double cadence of thought, the first referring to
the judgment of God, the second to the judgment
of men.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment:</div>
<div class="verse">Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The third part of the psalm is a terse, powerful
couplet, giving the reason for the different ending
of the two paths.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous:</div>
<div class="verse">But the way of the ungodly shall perish.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The thought-rhyme here is one of contrast.</p>

<p>A poem of very different character from this
brief, serious, impersonal sonnet is found in the
Forty-sixth Psalm, which might be called a National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Anthem. Here again the poem is divided into three
parts.</p>

<p>The first part (verses first to third) expresses a
sense of joyful confidence in the Eternal, amid the
tempests and confusions of earth. The thought-rhymes
are in couplets; and the second phrase, in
each case, emphasizes and enlarges the idea of the
first phrase.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">God is our refuge and strength:</div>
<div class="verse">A very present help in trouble.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The second part (verses fourth to seventh) describes
the peace and security of the city of God, surrounded
by furious enemies, but rejoicing in the Eternal
Presence. The parallel phrases here follow the same
rule as in the first part. The concluding phrase is
the stronger, the more emphatic. The seventh
verse gives the refrain or chorus of the anthem.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The Lord of hosts is with us:</div>
<div class="verse">The God of Jacob is our refuge.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The last part (verses eighth to tenth) describes
in a very vivid and concrete way the deliverance
of the people that have trusted in the Eternal. It
begins with a couplet, like those which have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
before. Then follow two stanzas of triple thought-rhymes,
in which the thought is stated and intensified
with each repetition.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth:</div>
<div class="verse">He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder:</div>
<div class="verse">He burneth the chariot in the fire.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Be still, and know that I am God:</div>
<div class="verse">I will be exalted among the heathen:</div>
<div class="verse">I will be exalted in the earth.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The anthem ends with a repetition of the refrain.</p>

<p>A careful study of the Psalms, even in English, will
enable the thoughtful reader to derive new pleasure
from them, by tracing the many modes and manners
in which this poetic form of thought-rhyme
is used to bind the composition together, and to
give balance and harmony to the poem.</p>

<p>Another element of poetic form can be discerned in
the Psalms, not directly, in the English version,
but by its effects. I mean the curious artifice of
alphabetic arrangement. It was a favourite practice
among Hebrew poets to begin their verses with
the successive letters of the alphabet, or sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to vary the device by making every verse in a
strophe begin with one letter, and every verse in
the next strophe with the following letter, and so
on to the end. The Twenty-fifth and the Thirty-seventh
Psalms were written by the first of these
rules; the One Hundred and Nineteenth Psalm
follows the second plan.</p>

<p>Of course the alphabetic artifice disappears entirely
in the English translation. But its effects
remain. The Psalms written in this manner usually
have but a single theme, which is repeated over
and over again, in different words and with new
illustrations. They are kaleidoscopic. The material
does not change, but it is turned this way
and that way, and shows itself in new shapes and
arrangements. These alphabetic psalms are characterized
by poverty of action and richness of expression.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Milton has already reminded us that the Psalms
belong to the second of the three orders into which
the Greeks, with clear discernment, divided all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
poetry: the epic, the lyric, and the dramatic. The
Psalms are rightly called lyrics because they are
chiefly concerned with the immediate and imaginative
expression of real feeling. It is the personal
and emotional note that predominates. They are
inward, confessional, intense; outpourings of the
quickened spirit; self-revelations of the heart. It
is for this reason that we should never separate
them in our thought from the actual human life
out of which they sprung. We must feel the warm
pulse of humanity in them in order to comprehend
their meaning and immortal worth. So far as we
can connect them with the actual experience of
men, this will help us to appreciate their reality
and power. The effort to do this will make plain
to us some other things which it is important to
remember.</p>

<p>We shall see at once that the book does not come
from a single writer, but from many authors and
ages. It represents the heart of man in communion
with God through a thousand years of history, from
Moses to Nehemiah, perhaps even to the time of
the Maccabean revival. It is, therefore, something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
very much larger and better than an individual
book.</p>

<p>It is the golden treasury of lyrics gathered from
the life of the Hebrew people, the hymn-book of
the Jews. And this gives to it a singular and precious
quality of brotherhood. The fault, or at least
the danger, of modern lyrical poetry is that it is
too solitary and separate in its tone. It tends
towards exclusiveness, over-refinement, morbid sentiment.
Many Christian hymns suffer from this
defect. But the Psalms breathe a spirit of human
fellowship even when they are most intensely personal.
The poet rejoices or mourns in solitude, it
may be, but he is not alone in spirit. He is one of
the people. He is conscious always of the ties that
bind him to his brother men. Compare the intense
selfishness of the modern hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I can but perish if I go;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I am resolved to try;</div>
<div class="verse">For if I stay away, I know</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I shall forever die;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">with the generous penitence of the Fifty-first Psalm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then will I teach transgressors thy way;</div>
<div class="verse">And sinners shall be converted unto thee.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>It is important to observe that there are several
different kinds of lyrics among the Psalms. Some
of them are simple and natural outpourings of a
single feeling, like <cite>A Shepherd’s Song about His
Shepherd</cite>, the incomparable Twenty-third Psalm.</p>

<p>This little poem is a perfect melody. It would
be impossible to express a pure, unmixed emotion—the
feeling of joy in the Divine Goodness—more
simply, with a more penetrating lyrical charm.
The “valley of the death-shadow,” the “enemies”
in whose presence the table is spread, are but dimly
suggested in the background. The atmosphere of
the psalm is clear and bright. The singing shepherd
walks in light. The whole world is the House of
the Lord, and life is altogether gladness.</p>

<p>How different is the tone, the quality, of the One
Hundred and Nineteenth Psalm! This is not a
melody, but a harmony; not a song, but an ode.
The ode has been defined as “a strain of exalted
and enthusiastic lyrical verse, directed to a fixed
purpose and dealing progressively with one dignified
theme.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This definition precisely fits the One
Hundred and Nineteenth Psalm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Its theme is <cite>The Eternal Word</cite>. Every verse in
the poem, except one, contains some name or description
of the law, commandments, testimonies,
precepts, statutes, or judgments of Jehovah. Its
enthusiasm for the Divine Righteousness never
fails from beginning to end. Its fixed purpose is
to kindle in other hearts the flame of devotion to
the one Holy Law. It closes with a touch of magnificent
pathos—a confession of personal failure
and an assertion of spiritual loyalty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I have gone astray like a lost sheep:</div>
<div class="verse">Seek thy servant:</div>
<div class="verse">For I do not forget thy commandments.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Fifteenth Psalm I should call a short didactic
lyric. Its title is <cite>The Good Citizen</cite>. It begins with
a question:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle?</div>
<div class="verse">Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This question is answered by the description of a
man whose character corresponds to the law of
God. First there is a positive sketch in three broad
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He that walketh uprightly,</div>
<div class="verse">And worketh righteousness,</div>
<div class="verse">And speaketh truth in his heart.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Then comes a negative characterization in a finely
touched triplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He that backbiteth not with his tongue,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor doeth evil to his neighbor,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is followed by a couplet containing a strong
contrast:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In whose eyes a vile person is contemned:</div>
<div class="verse">But he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then the description goes back to the negative
style again and three more touches are added to
the picture:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not,</div>
<div class="verse">He that putteth not out his money to usury,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor taketh reward against the innocent.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The poem closes with a single vigourous line, summing
up the character of the good citizen and answering
the question of the first verse with a new
emphasis of security and permanence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He that doeth these things shall never be moved.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Seventy-eighth, One Hundred and Fifth,
and One Hundred and Sixth Psalms are lyrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
ballads. They tell the story of Israel in Egypt,
and in the Wilderness, and in Canaan, with swift,
stirring phrases, and with splendid flashes of
imagery. Take this passage from the Seventy-eighth
Psalm as an example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">They were not estranged from their lust:</div>

<div class="verse"><em>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">And smote down the chosen men of Israel.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Forty-fifth Psalm is a Marriage Ode: the
Hebrew title calls it a Love Song. It bears all the
marks of having been composed for some royal
wedding-feast in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>There are many nature lyrics among the Psalms.
The Twenty-ninth is notable for its rugged realism.
It is a Song of Thunder.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Nineteenth is famous for its splendid comparison
between “the starry heavens and the moral
law.”</p>

<p>I think that we may find also some dramatic
lyrics among the Psalms—poems composed to express
the feelings of an historic person, like David
or Solomon, in certain well-known and striking experiences
of his life. That a later writer should
thus embody and express the truth dramatically
through the personality of some great hero of the
past, involves no falsehood. It is a mode of utterance
which has been common to the literature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
all lands and of all ages. Such a method of composition
would certainly be no hindrance to the
spirit of inspiration. The Thirty-first Psalm, for
instance, is ascribed by the title to David. But
there is strong reason, in the phraseology and in
the spirit of the poem, to believe that it was written
by the Prophet Jeremiah.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It is not to be supposed that our reverence for
the Psalms in their moral and religious aspects will
make us put them all on the same level poetically.
There is a difference among the books of the New
Testament in regard to the purity and dignity of
the Greek in which they are written. There is a
difference among St. Paul’s Epistles in regard to
the clearness and force of their style. There is a
difference even among the chapters of the same
epistle in regard to the beauty of thought and language.
In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, the
thirteenth chapter is poetic, and the fourteenth is
prosaic. Why should there not be a difference in
poetic quality among the Psalms?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a difference. The honest reader will
recognize it. It will be no harm to him if he should
have his favourites among the poems which have
been gathered from many centuries into this great
collection.</p>

<p>There are some, like the Twenty-seventh, the
Forty-second, the Forty-sixth, the Fifty-first, the
Sixty-third, the Ninety-first, the Ninety-sixth, the
One Hundred and Third, the One Hundred and
Seventh, the One Hundred and Thirty-ninth, which
rank with the noblest poetic literature of the world.
Others move on a lower level, and show the traces
of effort and constraint. There are also manifest
alterations and interpolations, which are not always
improvements. Dr. Perowne, who is one of the
wisest and most conservative of modern commentators,
says, “Many of the Psalms have not come
down to us in their original form,”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and refers to
the alterations which the Seventieth makes in the
Fortieth, and the Fifty-third in the Fourteenth.
The last two verses of the Fifty-first were evidently
added by a later hand. The whole book, in its present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
form, shows the marks of its compilation and
use as the Hymn-Book of the Jewish people. Not
only in the titles, but also in the text, we can discern
the work of the compiler, critic, and adapter,
sometimes wise, but occasionally otherwise.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The most essential thing in the appreciation of
the poetry in the Psalms is the recognition of the
three great spiritual qualities which distinguish
them.</p>

<p>The first of these is the deep and genuine love of
nature. The psalmists delight in the vision of the
world, and their joy quickens their senses to read
both the larger hieroglyphs of glory written in the
stars and the delicate tracings of transient beauty
on leaf and flower; to hear both the mighty roaring
of the sea and the soft sweet laughter of the rustling
corn-fields. But in all these they see the handwriting
and hear the voice of God. It is His presence
that makes the world sublime and beautiful.
The direct, piercing, elevating sense of this presence
simplifies, enlarges, and enables their style, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
makes it different from other nature-poetry. They
never lose themselves, as Theocritus and Wordsworth
and Shelley and Tennyson sometimes do, in
the contemplation and description of natural beauty.
They see it, but they always see beyond it. Compare,
for example, a modern versified translation
with the psalm itself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The spacious firmament on high,</div>
<div class="verse">With all the blue ethereal sky</div>
<div class="verse">And spangled heavens, a shining frame,</div>
<div class="verse">Their Great Original proclaim.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Addison’s descriptive epithets betray a conscious
effort to make a splendid picture. But the psalmist
felt no need of this; a larger impulse lifted him at
once into “the grand style:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The heavens declare the glory of God;</div>
<div class="verse">And the firmament showeth his handiwork.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The second quality of the poetry in the Psalms is
their passionate sense of the beauty of holiness.
Keats was undoubtedly right in his suggestion that
the poet must always see truth in the form of beauty.
Otherwise he may be a philosopher, or a critic, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
moralist, but he is not a true poet. But we must go
on from this standpoint to the Platonic doctrine
that the highest form of beauty is spiritual and
ethical. The poet must also see beauty in the light
of truth. It is the harmony of the soul with the
eternal music of the Good. And the highest poets
are those who, like the psalmists, are most ardently
enamoured of righteousness. This fills their songs
with sweetness and fire incomparable and immortal:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever:</div>
<div class="verse">The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.</div>
<div class="verse">More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:</div>
<div class="verse">Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The third quality of the poetry of the Psalms is
their intense joy in God. No lover ever poured
out the longings of his heart toward his mistress
more eagerly than the Psalmist voices his desire
and thirst for God. No conqueror ever sang of
victory more exultantly than the Psalmist rejoices
in the Lord, who is his light and his salvation, the
strength of his life and his portion forever.</p>

<p>After all, the true mission of poetry is to increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
joy. It must, indeed, be sensitive to sorrow and
acquainted with grief. But it has wings given to
it in order that it may bear us up into the air of
gladness.</p>

<p>There is no perfect joy without love. Therefore
love-poetry is the best. But the highest of all love-poetry
is that which celebrates, with the Psalms,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent3">that Love which is and was</div>
<div class="verse">My Father and my Brother and my God.</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>There are four kinds of novels.</p>

<p>First, those that are easy to read and hard to
remember: the well-told tales of no consequence,
the cream-puffs of perishable fiction.</p>

<p>Second, those that are hard to read and hard to
remember: the purpose-novels which are tedious
sermons in disguise, and the love-tales in which
there is no one with whom it is possible to fall in
love.</p>

<p>Third, those that are hard to read and easy to
remember: the books with a crust of perverse style
or faulty construction through which the reader
must break in order to get at the rich and vital
meaning.</p>

<p>Fourth, those that are easy to read and easy to
remember: the novels in which stories worth telling
are well-told, and characters worth observing are
vividly painted, and life is interpreted to the imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
in enduring forms of literary art. These
are the best-sellers which do not go out of print—everybody’s
books.</p>

<p>In this fourth class healthy-minded people and unprejudiced
critics put the novels of Charles Dickens.
For millions of readers they have fulfilled what Dr.
Johnson called the purpose of good books, to teach
us to enjoy life or help us to endure it. They have
awakened laughter and tears. They have enlarged
and enriched existence by revealing the hidden
veins of humour and pathos beneath the surface of
the every-day world, and by giving “the freedom
of the city” to those poor prisoners who had thought
of it only as the dwelling-place of so many hundred
thousand inhabitants and no real persons.</p>

<p>What a city it was that Dickens opened to us!
London, of course, in outward form and semblance,—the
London of the early Victorian epoch, with its
reeking Seven Dials close to its perfumed Piccadilly,
with its grimy river-front and its musty Inns of
Court and its mildly rural suburbs, with its rollicking
taverns and its deadly solemn residential squares
and its gloomy debtors’ prisons and its gaily insanitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
markets, with all its consecrated conventions
and unsuspected hilarities,—vast, portentous,
formal, merry, childish, inexplicable, a wilderness
of human homes and haunts, ever thrilling with
sincerest passion, mirth, and pain,—London it was,
as the eye saw it in those days, and as the curious
traveller may still retrace some of its vanishing
landmarks and fading features.</p>

<p>But it was more than London, after Dickens
touched it. It was an enchanted city, where the
streets seemed to murmur of joy or fear, where the
dark faces of the dens of crime scowled or leered at
you, and the decrepit houses doddered in senility,
and the new mansions stared you down with stolid
pride. Everything spoke or made a sign to you.
From red-curtained windows jollity beckoned.
From prison-doors lean hands stretched toward
you. Under bridges and among slimy piers the
river gurgled, and chuckled, and muttered unholy
secrets. Across trim front-yards little cottages
smiled and almost nodded their good-will. There
were no dead spots, no deaf and dumb regions. All
was alive and significant. Even the real estate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
became personal. One felt that it needed but a
word, a wave of the wand, to bring the buildings
leaping, roistering, creeping, tottering, stalking from
their places.</p>

<p>It was an enchanted city, and the folk who filled
it and almost, but never quite, crowded it to suffocation,
were so intensely and supernaturally human,
so blackly bad, so brightly good, so touchingly pathetic,
so supremely funny, that they also were
creatures of enchantment and seemed to come from
fairy-land.</p>

<p>For what is fairy-land, after all? It is not an
invisible region, an impossible place. It is only
the realm of the hitherto unobserved, the not yet
realized, where the things we have seen but never
noticed, and the persons we have met but never
known, are suddenly “translated,” like Bottom the
Weaver, and sent forth upon strange adventures.</p>

<p>That is what happens to the Dickens people.
Good or bad they surpass themselves when they
get into his books. That rotund Brownie, Mr. Pickwick,
with his amazing troupe; that gentle compound
of Hop-o’-my-Thumb and a Babe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Wood, Oliver Twist, surrounded by wicked uncles,
and hungry ogres, and good fairies in bottle-green
coats; that tender and lovely Red Riding-Hood,
Little Nell; that impetuous Hans-in-Luck, Nicholas
Nickleby; that intimate Cinderella, Little Dorrit;
that simple-minded Aladdin, Pip; all these, and
a thousand more like them, go rambling through
Dickensopolis and behaving naturally in a most
extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>Things that have seldom or never happened,
occur inevitably. The preposterous becomes the
necessary, the wildly improbable is the one thing
that must come to pass. Mr. Dombey is converted,
Mr. Krook is removed by spontaneous combustion,
Mr. Micawber performs amazing feats as an amateur
detective, Sam Weller gets married, the immortally
absurd epitaphs of Young John Chivery
and Mrs. Sapsea are engraved upon monuments
more lasting than brass.</p>

<p>The fact is, Dickens himself was bewitched by
the spell of his own imagination. His people carried
him away, did what they liked with him. He
wrote of Little Nell: “You can’t imagine how exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
I am to-day with yesterday’s labours. I
went to bed last night utterly dispirited and done
up. All night I have been pursued by the child;
and this morning I am unrefreshed and miserable.
I don’t know what to do with myself.... I think
the close of the story will be great.” Again he says:
“As to the way in which these characters have
opened out [in <cite>Martin Chuzzlewit</cite>], that is to me
one of the most surprising processes of the mind in
this sort of invention. Given what one knows,
what one does not know springs up; and I am <em>as
absolutely certain of its being true, as I am of the
law of gravitation</em>—if such a thing is possible, more
so.”</p>

<p>Precisely such a thing (as Dickens very well understood)
is not only possible, but unavoidable.
For what certainty have we of the law of gravitation?
Only by hearsay, by the submissive reception
of a process of reasoning conducted for us by Sir
Isaac Newton and other vaguely conceived men of
science. The fall of an apple is an intense reality
(especially if it falls upon your head); but the law
which regulates its speed is for you an intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
abstraction as remote as the idea of a “combination
in restraint of trade,” or the definition of “art for
art’s sake.” Whereas the irrepressible vivacity of
Sam Weller, and the unctuous hypocrisy of Pecksniff,
and the moist humility of Uriah Heep, and
the sublime conviviality of Dick Swiveller, and the
triumphant make-believe of the Marchioness are
facts of experience. They have touched you, and
you cannot doubt them. The question whether
they are actual or imaginary is purely academic.</p>

<p>Another fairy-land feature of Dickens’s world is
the way in which minor personages of the drama
suddenly take the centre of the stage and hold the
attention of the audience. It is always so in fairy-land.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Tempest</cite>, what are Prospero and Miranda,
compared with Caliban and Ariel? In <cite>A Midsummer
Night’s Dream</cite>, who thinks as much of Oberon
and Titania, as of Puck, and Bottom the Weaver?
Even in an historical drama like Henry IV, we feel
that Falstaff is the most historic character.</p>

<p>Dickens’s first lady and first gentleman are often
less memorable than his active supernumeraries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
A hobgoblin like Quilp, a good old nurse like Peggotty,
a bad old nurse like Sairey Gamp, a volatile
elf like Miss Mowcher, a shrewd elf and a blunder-headed
elf like Susan Nipper and Mr. Toots, a good-natured
disreputable sprite like Charley Bates, a
malicious gnome like Noah Claypole, a wicked ogre
like Wackford Squeers, a pair of fairy-godmothers
like the Cheeryble Brothers, a dandy ouphe like
Mr. Mantalini, and a mischievous, wooden-legged
kobold like Silas Wegg, take stronger hold upon us
than the Harry Maylies and Rose Flemings, the
John Harmons and Bella Wilfers, for whose ultimate
matrimonial felicity the business of the plot is conducted.
Even the more notable heroes often pale
a little by comparison with their attendants. Who
remembers Martin Chuzzlewit as clearly as his servant
Mark Tapley? Is Pip, with his Great Expectations,
half as delightful as his clumsy dry-nurse
Joe Gargery? Has even the great Pickwick a
charm to compare with the unique, immortal Sam
Weller?</p>

<p>Do not imagine that Dickens was unconscious of
this disarrangement of rôles, or that it was an evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of failure on his part. He knew perfectly
well what he was doing. Great authors always do.
They cannot help it, and they do not care. Homer
makes Agamemnon and Priam the kings of his tale,
and Paris the first walking gentleman and Helen
the leading lady. But Achilles and Ajax and Hector
are the bully boys, and Ulysses is the wise jester,
and Thersites the tragic clown. As for Helen,—</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The face that launched a thousand ships,</div>
<div class="verse">And burnt the topless towers of Ilium—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">her reputed pulchritude means less to us than the
splendid womanhood of Andromache, or the wit
and worth of the adorable matron Penelope.</p>

<p>Now this unconventionality of art, which disregards
ranks and titles, even those of its own making,
and finds the beautiful and the absurd, the
grotesque and the picturesque, the noble and the
base, not according to the programme but according
to the fact, is precisely the essence of good
enchantment.</p>

<p>Good enchantment goes about discovering the ass
in the lion’s skin and the wolf in sheep’s clothing,
the princess in the goose-girl and the wise man under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the fool’s cap, the pretender in the purple robe and
the rightful heir in rags, the devil in the belfry and
the Redeemer among the publicans and sinners. It
is the spirit of revelation, the spirit of divine sympathy
and laughter, the spirit of admiration, hope,
and love—or better still, it is simply the spirit of
life.</p>

<p>When I call this the essence of good enchantment
I do not mean that it is unreal. I mean only that it
is <em>unrealistic</em>, which is just the opposite of unreal.
It is not in bondage to the beggarly elements of form
and ceremony. It is not captive to names and appearances,
though it revels in their delightful absurdity.
It knows that an idol is nothing, and finds
all the more laughter in its pompous pretence of
being something. It can afford to be merry because
it is in earnest; it is happy because it has not forgotten
how to weep; it is content because it is still
unsatisfied; it is humble in the sense of unfathomed
faults and exalted in the consciousness of inexhaustible
power; it calls nothing common or unclean; it
values life for its mystery, its surprisingness, and its
divine reversals of human prejudice,—just like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Beauty and the Beast and the story of the Ugly
Duckling.</p>

<p>This, I say, is the essence of good enchantment;
and it is also the essence of true religion. “For God
hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound
the wise, and the weak things of the world
to confound the mighty, and base things of the
world and things which are despised, yea, and
<em>things which are not, to bring to naught things which
are.</em>”</p>

<p>This is also the essence of real democracy, which
is not a theory of government but a state of mind.</p>

<p>No one has ever expressed it better than Charles
Dickens did in a speech which he made at Hartford,
Connecticut, seventy years ago. “I have
faith,” said he, “and I wish to diffuse faith in the
existence—yes, of beautiful things, even in those
conditions of society which are so degenerate, so
degraded and forlorn, that at first sight it would
seem as though it could only be described by a
strange and terrible reversal of the words of Scripture—God
said let there be light, and there was
none. I take it that we are born, and that we hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
our sympathies, hopes, and energies in trust for the
Many and not the Few. That we cannot hold in
too strong a light of disgust and contempt, before
our own view and that of others, all meanness, falsehood,
cruelty, and oppression of every grade and
kind. Above all, that nothing is high because it is
in a high place; and that nothing is low because it
is in a low place. This is the lesson taught us in
the great book of Nature. This is the lesson which
may be read alike in the bright track of the stars,
and in the dusty course of the poorest thing that
drags its tiny length upon the ground.”</p>

<p>This was the creed of Dickens; and like every
man’s creed, conscious or unconscious, confessed or
concealed, it made him what he was.</p>

<p>It has been said that he had no deep philosophy,
no calmly reasoned and clearly stated theory of the
universe. Perhaps that is true. Yet I believe he
hardly missed it. He was too much interested in
living to be anxious about a complete theory of
life. Perhaps it would have helped him when trouble
came, when domestic infelicity broke up his home,
if he could have climbed into some philosopher’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
ivory tower. Perhaps not. I have observed that
even the most learned and philosophic mortals, under
these afflictions, sometimes fail to appreciate the
consolations of philosophy to any noticeable extent.
From their ivory towers they cry aloud, being in
pain, even as other men.</p>

<p>But it was certainly not true (even though his
biographer wrote it, and it has been quoted a thousand
times), that just because Dickens cried aloud,
“there was for him no ‘city of the mind’ against
outward ills, for inner consolation and shelter.” He
was not cast out and left comfortless. Faith, hope,
and charity—these three abode with him. His
human sympathy, his indomitable imagination, his
immense and varied interest in the strange adventures
of men and women, his unfaltering intuition
of the truer light of God that burns</p>

eternal though unseen. Ever building, changing,
never falling, thy walls are open-gated day and

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Of the outward appearance, or, as <cite>Sartor Resartus</cite>
would have called it, the Time-Vesture and
Flesh-Garment of that flaming light-particle which
was cast hither from Heaven in the person of Charles
Dickens, and of his ways and manners while he
hasted jubilantly and stormfully across the astonished
Earth, something must be said here.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens was born at Portsea, in 1812,
an offspring of what the accurate English call the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
“lower middle class.” Inheriting something from
a father who was decidedly Micawberish, and a
mother who resembled Mrs. Nickleby, Charles was
not likely to be a humdrum child. But the remarkable
thing about him was the intense, aspiring, and
gaily sensible spirit with which he entered into the
business of developing whatever gifts he had received
from his vague and amiable parents.</p>

<p>The fat streak of comfort in his childish years,
when his proud father used to stand the tiny lad
on a table to sing comic songs for an applauding
audience of relatives, could not spoil him. The
lean streak of misery, when the improvident family
sprawled in poverty, with its head in a debtors’
prison, while the bright, delicate, hungry boy roamed
the streets, or drudged in a dirty blacking-factory,
could not starve him. The two dry years of school
at Wellington House Academy could not fossilize
him. The years from fifteen to nineteen, when he
was earning his bread as office-boy, lawyers’ clerk,
shorthand reporter, could not commercialize him.
Through it all he burned his way painfully and
joyously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>He was not to be detailed as a perpetual comic
songster in upholstered parlors; nor as a prosperous
frock-coated citizen with fatty degeneration of the
mind; nor as a newspaper politician, a power beneath
the footstool. None of these alluring prospects
delayed him. He passed them by, observing
everything as he went, now hurrying, now sauntering,
for all the world like a boy who has been
sent somewhere. Where it was, he found out in
his twenty-fifth year, when the extraordinary results
of his self-education bloomed in the <cite>Pickwick
Papers</cite> and <cite>Oliver Twist.</cite></p>

<p>Never was a good thing coming out of Nazareth
more promptly welcomed. The simple-minded
critics of that day had not yet discovered the damning
nature of popularity, and they hailed the new
genius in spite of the fact that hundreds of thousands
of people were reading his books. His success
was exhilarating, overwhelming, and at times
intoxicating.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">It was roses, roses all the way.—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Some of them had thorns, which hurt his thin skin
horribly, but they never made him despair or doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the goodness of the universe. Being vexed, he let
it off in anger instead of distilling it into pessimism
to poison himself. Life was too everlastingly interesting
for him to be long unhappy. A draught of
his own triumph would restore him, a slice of his
own work would reinvigorate him, and he would go
on with his industrious dreaming.</p>

<p>No one enjoyed the reading of his books more
than he the making of them, though he sometimes
suffered keenly in the process. That was a proof
of his faith that happiness does not consist in the
absence of suffering, but in the presence of joy.
Dulness, insincerity, stupid humbug—<i lang="fr">voilà l’ennemi!</i>
So he lived and wrote with a high hand and an outstretched
arm. He made men see what he saw,
and hate what he hated, and love what he loved.
This was his great reward,—more than money,
fame, or hosts of friends,—that he saw the children
of his brain enter into the common life of the world.</p>

<p class="caption">CHARLES DICKENS AS CAPTAIN BOBADIL IN “EVERY MAN IN HIS HUMOUR.”</p>
<p class="caption">Painted by C. R. Leslie.</p>
</div>

<p>But he was not exempt from the ordinary laws
of nature. The conditions of his youth left their
marks for good and evil on his maturity. The petting
of his babyhood gave him the habit of showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
off. We often see him as a grown man, standing
on the table and reciting his little piece, or singing
his little song, to please an admiring audience. He
delighted in playing to the galleries.</p>

<p>His early experience of poverty made him at once
tremendously sympathetic and invincibly optimistic—both
of which virtues belong to the poor more
than to the rich. Dickens understood this and never
forgot it. The chief moralities of his poor people
are mutual helpfulness and unquenchable hopefulness.
From them, also, he caught the tone of material
comfort which characterizes his visions of the
reward of virtue. Having known cold and hunger,
he simply could not resist the desire to make his
favourite characters—if they stayed on earth till the
end of the book—warm and “comfy,” and to give
them plenty to eat and drink. This may not have
been artistic, but it was intensely human.</p>

<p>The same personal quality may be noted in his
ardour as a reformer. No writer of fiction has ever
done more to better the world than Charles Dickens.
But he did not do it by setting forth programmes
of legislation and theories of government. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
matter of fact, he professed an amusing “contempt
for the House of Commons,” having been a Parliamentary
reporter; and of Sir Robert Peel, who
emancipated the Catholics, enfranchised the Jews,
and repealed the Corn Laws, he thought so little
that he caricatured him as Mr. Pecksniff.</p>

<p>Dickens felt the evils of the social order at the
precise point where the shoe pinched; he did not go
back to the place where the leather was tanned or
the last designed. It was some practical abuse in
poorhouses or police-courts or prisons; it was some
hidden shame in the conduct of schools, or the renting
of tenements; it was some monumental absurdity
in the Circumlocution Office, some pompous
and cruel delay in the course of justice, that made
him hot with indignation. These were the things
that he assailed with Rabelaisian laughter, or over
which he wept with a deeper and more sincere pity
than that of Tristram Shandy. His idea was that
if he could get people to see that a thing was both
ridiculous and cruel, they would want to stop it.
What would come after that, he did not clearly
know, nor had he any particularly valuable suggestions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to make, except the general proposition
that men should do justly, and love mercy, and
walk humbly with their God.</p>

<p>He took no stock in the doleful predictions of
the politicians that England was in an awful state
merely because Lord Coodle was going out of office,
and Sir Thomas Doodle would not come in, and
each of these was the only man to save the country.
The trouble seemed to him deeper and more
real. It was a certain fat-witted selfishness, a certain
callous, complacent blindness in the people
who were likely to read his books. He conceived
that his duty as a novelist was done when he had
shown up the absurd and hateful things, and made
people laugh at their ugliness, weep over their inhumanity,
and long to sweep them away.</p>

<p>In this attitude, I think, Dickens was not only
natural, and true to his bringing-up, but also wise
as a great artist in literature. For I have observed
that brilliant writers, while often profitable as satirists
to expose abuses, are seldom judicious as
legislators to plan reforms.</p>

<p>Before we leave this subject of the effects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Dickens’s early poverty and sudden popularity, we
must consider his alleged lack of refinement. Some
say that he was vulgar, others that he was ungrateful
and inconsiderate of the feelings of his friends
and relations, others that he had little or no taste.
I should rather say, in the words of the old epigram,
that he had a great deal of taste, and that some of
it was very bad.</p>

<p>Take the matter of his caricaturing real people in
his books. No one could object to his use of the
grotesque insolence of a well-known London magistrate
as the foundation of his portrait of Mr. Fang
in <cite>Oliver Twist.</cite> That was public property. But
the amiable eccentricities of his own father and
mother, the airy irresponsible ways of his good
friend Leigh Hunt, were private property. Yet
even here Dickens could not reasonably be blamed
for observing them, for being amused by them, or
for letting them enrich his general sense of the immense,
incalculable, and fantastic humour of the
world. Taste, which is simply another name for
the gusto of life, has a comic side; and a man who
is keenly sensitive to everything cannot be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to be blind to the funny things that happen among
his family and friends. But when Dickens used
these private delights for the public amusement,
and in such a form that the partial portraits of Mr.
and Mrs. Micawber, Mrs. Nickleby, and Harold
Skimpole were easily identified, all that we can say
is that his taste was still there, but it had gone bad.
What could you expect? Where, in his early years,
was he likely to have learned the old-fashioned
habit of reserve in regard to private affairs, which
you may call either a mark of good manners, or a
sign of silly pride, according to your own education?</p>

<p>Or take his behavior during his first visit to America
in 1842, and immediately after his return to
England. His reception was enough to turn anybody’s
head. “There never was a king or emperor,”
wrote Dickens to a friend, “so cheered and followed
by crowds, and entertained at splendid balls and
dinners, and waited upon by public bodies of all
kinds.” This was at the beginning. At the end he
was criticized by all, condemned by many, and
abused by some of the newspapers. Why? Chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
because he used the dinners given in his honour as
occasions to convict the Americans of their gross
national sin of literary piracy, and because when he
got home he wrote a book of <cite>American Notes</cite>, containing
some very severe strictures upon the country
which had just entertained him so magnificently.</p>

<p>Mr. Chesterton defends Dickens for his attack
upon the American practice of book-stealing which
grew out of the absence of an International Copyright
Law. He says that it was only the new, raw
sensibility of the Americans that was hurt by these
speeches. “Dickens was not in the least desirous
of being thought too ‘high-souled’ to want his
wages.... He asked for his money in a valiant
and ringing voice, like a man asking for his honour.”
And this, Mr. Chesterton leaves us to infer, is what
any bold Englishman, as distinguished from a
timidly refined American, would do.</p>

<p>Precisely. But if the bold Englishman had been
gently-bred would he have accepted an invitation
to dinner in order that he might publicly say to his
host, in a valiant and ringing voice, “You owe me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a thousand pounds”? Such procedure at the dinner-table
is contrary not only to good manners but
also to good digestion. This is what Mr. Chesterton’s
bold British constitution apparently prevents
him from seeing. What Dickens said about international
copyright was right. But he was
wretchedly wrong in his choice of the time and
place for saying it. The natural irritation which
his bad taste produced was one of the causes which
delayed for fifty years the success of the efforts of
American authors to secure copyright for foreign
authors.</p>

<p>The same criticism applies to the <cite>American Notes</cite>.
Read them again and you will see that they are not
bad notes. With much that he says about Yankee
boastfulness and superficiality, and the evils of
slavery, and the dangers of yellow journalism, every
sane American will agree to-day. But the occasion
which Dickens took for making these remarks was
not happily chosen. It was as if a man who had
just been entertained at your house should write
to thank you for the pleasure of the visit, and improve
the opportunity to point out the shocking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
defects of your domestic service and the exceedingly
bad tone which pervaded your establishment. Such
a “bread-and-butter letter” might be full of good
morals, but their effect would be diminished by its
bad manners. Of this Dickens was probably quite
unconscious. He acted spontaneously, irrepressibly,
vivaciously, in accordance with his own taste; and
it surprised and irritated him immensely that people
were offended by it.</p>

<p>It was precisely so in regard to his personal appearance.
When the time suddenly arrived that he
could indulge his taste in dress without fear of financial
consequences, he did so hilariously and to the
fullest extent. Here is a description of him as he
appeared to an American girl at an evening party
in Cincinnati eighty years ago. “He is young and
handsome, has a mellow beautiful eye, fine brow
and abundant hair.... His manner is easy and
negligent, but not elegant. His dress was foppish....
He had a dark coat with lighter pantaloons;
a black waistcoat embroidered with coloured flowers;
and about his neck, covering his white shirt-front,
was a black neck-cloth also embroidered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
colours, on which were two large diamond pins connected
by a chain; a gold watch-chain and a large
red rose in his buttonhole completed his toilet.”</p>

<p>The young lady does not seem to have been delighted
with this costume. But Dickens did not
dress to please her, he dressed to please himself.
His taste was so exuberant that it naturally effervesced
in this kind of raiment. There was certainly
nothing immoral about it. He had paid for
it and he had a right to wear it, for to him it seemed
beautiful. He would have been amazed to know
that any young lady did not like it; and her opinion
would probably have had little effect upon him, for
he wrote of the occasion on which this candid girl
met him, as follows: “In the evening we went to
a party at Judge Walker’s and were introduced to
at least one hundred and fifty first-rate bores, separately
and singly.”</p>

<p>But what does it all amount to, this lack of discretion
in manners, this want of reserve in speech,
this oriental luxuriance in attire? It simply goes
to show that <em>Dickens himself was a Dickens character</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>He was vivid, florid, inexhaustible, and untamed.
There was material in the little man for a hundred
of his own immortal caricatures. The self-portrait
that he has drawn in <cite>David Copperfield</cite> is too smooth,
like a retouched photograph. That is why David is
less interesting than half-a-dozen other people in the
book. If Dickens could have seen his own humourous
aspects in the magic mirror of his fancy, it would
have been among the richest of his observations,
and if he could have let his enchantment loose upon
the subject, not even the figures of Dick Swiveller
and Harold Skimpole would have been more memorable
than the burlesque of “Boz” by the hand
of C. D.</p>

<p>But the humourous, the extravagant, the wildly
picturesque,—would these have given a true and
complete portrait of the man? Does it make any
great difference what kind of clothes he wore, or
how many blunders of taste and tact he made, even
tragic blunders like his inability to refrain from
telling the world all about his domestic unhappiness,—does
all this count for much when we look
back upon the wonders which his imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
wrought in fiction, and upon the generous fruits
which his heart brought forth in life?</p>

<p>It is easy to endure small weaknesses when you
can feel beneath them the presence of great and
vital power. Faults are forgiven readily in one
who has the genius of loving much. Better many
blunders than the supreme mistake of a life that is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Charles Dickens never made, nor indeed was
tempted to make, that mistake. He carried with
him the defects of his qualities, the marks of his
early life, the penalties of his bewildering success.
But, look you, <em>he carried them</em>—they did not crush
him nor turn him from his true course. Forward
he marched, cheering and beguiling the way for his
comrades with mirthful stories and tales of pity,
lightening many a burden and consoling many a
dark and lonely hour, until he came at last to the
goal of honour and the haven of happy rest. Those
who knew him best saw him most clearly as Carlyle
did: “The good, the gentle, high-gifted, ever-friendly,
noble Dickens,—every inch of him an Honest
Man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>As an artist in fiction Dickens was great; but not
because he had a correct theory of the technique of
the novel, not because he always followed good rules
and models in writing, nor because he was one</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Who saw life steadily and saw it whole.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the contrary, his vision of life, though vivid,
was almost always partial. He was capable of
doing a great deal of bad work, which he himself
liked. The plots of his novels, on which he toiled
tremendously, are negligible; indeed it is often difficult
to follow and impossible to remember them.
The one of his books that is notably fine in structure
and approximately faultless in technique—<cite>A Tale
of Two Cities</cite>—is so unlike his other novels that it
stands in a class by itself, as an example of what he
could have done if he had chosen to follow that line.
In a way it is his most perfect piece of work. But it
is not his most characteristic piece of work, and
therefore I think it has less value for us than some
of his other books in which his peculiar, distinctive,
unrivalled powers are more fully shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, art must not only interpret the world
but also reveal the artist. The lasting interest of
his vision, its distinction, its charm, depend, at
least in some real degree, upon the personal touch.
Being himself a part of the things that are seen, he
must “paint the thing <em>as he sees it</em>” if he wishes to
win the approval of “the God of things as they are.”</p>

<p>Now the artistic value of Dickens’s way of seeing
things lay in its fitness to the purpose which he had
in mind and heart,—a really great purpose, namely,
to enhance the interest of life by good enchantment,
to save people from the plague of dulness and
the curse of indifference by showing them that the
world is full of the stuff for hearty laughter and deep
sympathy. This way of seeing things, with constant
reference to their humourous and sentimental
potency, was essential to the genius of Dickens.
His method of making other people see it was
strongly influenced, if not absolutely determined, by
two facts which seemed to lie outside of his career
as an author: first, his training as a reporter for the
press; second, his favourite avocation as an amateur
actor, stage-manager, and dramatic reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The style of Dickens at its best is that of an inspired
reporter. It is rapid, graphic, pictorial,
aiming always at a certain heightening of effect,
making the shadows darker and the lights brighter
for the purpose of intensifying sensation. He did
not get it in the study but in the street. Take his
description in <cite>Martin Chuzzlewit</cite> of Todgers’s Boarding
House with its complicated smells and its mottled
shades of dinginess; or take his picture in
<cite>Little Dorrit</cite> of Marseilles burning in the August
sunlight with its broad, white, universal stare.
Here is the art of journalism,—the trick of intensification
by omission,—carried to the limit. He
aims distinctly at a certain effect, and he makes
sure of getting it.</p>

<p>He takes long walks in the heart of London,
attends police courts, goes behind the scenes of
theatres, rides in omnibuses, visits prisons and workhouses.
You think he is seeking realism. Quite
wrong. He is seeking a sense of reality which shall
make realism look cheap. He is not trying to put
up canned goods which shall seem more or less like
fresh vegetables. He is trying to extract the essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
flavour of places and people so that you can
taste it in a drop.</p>

<p>We find in his style an accumulation of details all
bearing on a certain point; nothing that serves his
purpose is overlooked; everything that is likely to
distract the attention or obscure his aim is disregarded.
The head-lines are in the text. When
the brute, Bill Sykes, says to Nancy: “Get up,”
you know what is coming. When Mrs. Todgers
gives a party to Mr. Pecksniff you know what is
coming. But the point is that when it comes,
tragedy or comedy, it is as pure and unadulterated
as the most brilliant of reporters could make it.</p>

<p>Naturally, Dickens puts more emphasis upon the
contrast between his characters than upon the contrast
within them. The internal inconsistencies
and struggles, the slow processes of growth and
change which are the delight of the psychological
novelist do not especially interest him. He sees
things black or white, not gray. The objects that
attract him most, and on which he lavishes his art,
do not belong to the average, but to the extraordinary.
Dickens is not a commonplace merchant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
He is a dealer in oddities and rarities, in fact the
keeper of an “Old Curiosity Shop,” and he knows
how to set forth his goods with incomparable skill.</p>

<p>His drawing of character is sharp rather than
deep. He makes the figure stand out, always recognizable,
but not always thoroughly understood.
Many of his people are simply admirable incarnations
of their particular trades or professions: Mould
the undertaker, old Weller the coachman, Tulkinghorn
the lawyer, Elijah Program the political demagogue,
Blimber the school-master, Stiggins the religious
ranter, Betsey Prig the day-nurse, Cap’n
Cuttle the retired skipper. They are all as easy to
identify as the wooden image in front of a tobacconist’s
shop. Others are embodiments of a single passion
or quality: Pecksniff of unctuous hypocrisy,
Micawber of joyous improvidence, Mr. Toots of
dumb sentimentalism, Little Dorrit of the motherly
instinct in a girl, Joe Gargery of the motherly instinct
in a man, Mark Tapley of resolute and strenuous
optimism. If these persons do anything out of
harmony with their head-lines, Dickens does not tell
of it. He does not care for the incongruities, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
modifications, the fine shadings which soften and
complicate the philosophic and reflective view of life.
He wants to write his “story” sharply, picturesquely,
with “snap” and plenty of local colour; and
he does it, in his happiest hours, with all the <em>verve</em>
and skill of a star reporter for the <cite>Morning Journal</cite>
of the Enchanted City.</p>

<p>In this graphic and emphatic quality the art of
Dickens in fiction resembles the art of Hogarth in
painting. But Dickens, like Hogarth, was much
more than a reporter. He was a dramatist, and
therefore he was also, by necessity, a moralist.</p>

<p>I do not mean that Dickens had a dramatic genius
in the Greek sense that he habitually dealt with
the eternal conflict between human passion and inscrutable
destiny. I mean only this: that his lifelong
love for the theatre often led him, consciously
or unconsciously, to construct the <em>scenario</em> of a
story with a view to dramatic effect, and to work
up the details of a crisis precisely as if he saw it in
his mind’s eye on the stage.</p>

<p>Notice how the <i lang="la">dramatis personæ</i> are clearly
marked as comic, or tragic, or sentimental. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
moment they come upon the scene you can tell
whether they are meant to appeal to your risibilities
or to your sensibilities. You are in no danger of
laughing at the heroine, or weeping over the funny
man. Dickens knows too much to leave his audience
in perplexity. He even gives to some of his personages
set phrases, like the musical <i lang="fr">motifs</i> of the
various characters in the operas of Wagner, by
which you may easily identify them. Mr. Micawber
is forever “waiting for something to turn up.” Mr.
Toots always reminds us that “it’s of no consequence.”
Sairey Gamp never appears without her
imaginary friend Mrs. Harris. Mrs. General has
“prunes and prism” perpetually on her lips.</p>

<p>Observe, also, how carefully the scene is set, and
how wonderfully the preparation is made for a dramatic
climax in the story. If it is a comic climax,
like the trial of Mr. Pickwick for breach of promise,
nothing is forgotten, from the hysterics of the obese
Mrs. Bardell to the feigned indignation of Sergeant
Buzfuz over the incriminating phrase “chops and
tomato sauce!”</p>

<p>If it is a tragic climax, like the death of Bill Sykes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a score of dark premonitions lead up to it, the
dingiest slum of London is chosen for it, the grimy
streets are filled with a furious crowd to witness it,
and just as the murderer is about to escape, the
ghostly eyes of his victim glare upon him, and he
plunges from the roof, tangled in his rope, to be
hanged by the hand of the Eternal Judge as surely
as if he stood upon the gallows.</p>

<p>Or suppose the climax is not one of shame and
terror, but of pure pity and tenderness, like the
death of Little Nell. Then the quiet room is prepared
for it, and the white bed is decked with winter
berries and green leaves that the child loved
because they loved the light; and gentle friends are
there to read and talk to her, and she sleeps herself
away in loving dreams, and the poor old grandfather,
whom she has guided by the hand and comforted,
kneels at her bedside, wondering why his
dear Nell lies so still, and the very words which tell
us of her peace and his grief, move rhythmically
and plaintively, like soft music with a dying fall.</p>

<p>Close the book. The curtain descends. The
drama is finished. The master has had his way with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
us; he has made us laugh; he has made us cry.
We have been at the play.</p>

<p>But was it not as real to us while it lasted as many
of the scenes in which we actors daily take our parts?
And did it not mellow our spirits with mirth, and
soften our hearts with tears? And now that it is
over are we not likely to be a little better, a little
kinder, a little happier for what we have laughed
at or wept over?</p>

<p>Ah, master of the good enchantment, you have
given us hours of ease and joy, and we thank you
for them. But there is a greater gift than that.
You have made us more willing to go cheerfully
and companionably along the strange, crowded,
winding way of human life, because you have deepened
our faith that there is something of the divine
on earth, and something of the human in heaven.</p>

<p>In that fragrant bunch of <cite>Theodore Roosevelt’s
Letters to His Children</cite> which has just brightened
and sweetened our too sadly strenuous times there
are some passages on novel-reading which are full
of spirited good sense. He says that he can read
<cite>Pendennis</cite>, and <cite>The Newcomes</cite>, and <cite>Vanity Fair</cite>
over and over again; he agrees with his boy in preferring
Thackeray to Dickens, and then he gives
the reason—or at least <em>a</em> reason—for this preference:</p>

<p>“Of course one fundamental difference ... is
that Thackeray was a gentleman and Dickens was
not.”</p>

<p>The damnatory clause in this sentence seems to
me too absolute, though Roosevelt softens it by
adding, “but a man might do some mighty good
work without being in any sense a gentleman.”
That is certainly true, and beyond a doubt Dickens
did it—a wonderful plenty of it. It is also true
that in several perfectly good senses he was a brave
and kind gentleman, despite his faults in manners
and dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is the laudatory clause in Roosevelt’s judgment
that interests me. Thackeray’s work is pervaded
with his personality to an unusual degree.
It is a saturated solution of the man. We can taste
him in every page. And it is because we like the
taste, because we find something strong and true,
bracing and stimulant in it, that we love to read
him. ’Tis like being with a gentleman in any enterprise
or adventure; it gives us pleasure and does us
unconscious good.</p>

<p>Well, then, what do we mean by “a gentleman?”
Tennyson calls it</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">The grand old name of gentleman</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Defamed by every charlatan,</div>
<div class="verse">And soil’d with all ignoble use.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the big New Oxford Dictionary there is more
than a pageful of definitions of the word, and almost
every English essayist has tried a shot at it.
One thing is sure, its old hereditary use as a title
of rank or property is going out, or already gone.
“John Jones, Gent.,” is a vanishing form of address.
More and more the word is coming to connote
something in character and conduct. Inheritance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
may enter into it, and the sense of honour has
a great part in it, and its outward and visible sign
is an unassuming fitness of behaviour in the various
circumstances of life. But its indispensable essence
is reality; its native speech, sincerity; and its controlling
spirit, good-will.</p>

<p>Let us content ourselves with a description instead
of a definition. A gentleman is a real man
who deals honestly, bravely, frankly, and considerately
with all sorts and conditions of other real
men.</p>

<p>This is Thackeray’s very mark and quality. We
can feel it all through his life and works. Everything
real in the world he recognized and accepted,
even though he might not always like it. But the
unreal people and things—the pretenders, the hypocrites,
the shams, and the frauds (whether pious or
impious)—he detested and scoffed away. Reality
was his quest and his passion. He followed it with
unfailing interest, penetration, and good temper.
He found it, at least in humankind, always mixed
and complicated, never altogether good nor altogether
bad, no hero without a fault, and no villain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
without a germ of virtue. Life is really made that
way. The true realist is not the materialist, the
five-sense naturalist, but the man who takes into
account the human soul and God as ultimate realities.</p>

<p>Thackeray’s personal life had nothing that was
remarkable and much that was admirable. It was
simply the background of his genius. He was a
child of the upper-middle class in England—if you
know just what that means. He went to the Charterhouse
School in London (which he afterward
immortalized as Greyfriars in <cite>The Newcomes</cite>), and
illustrated his passion for reality by getting his nose
broken in a fight, which gave his face a permanent
Socratic cast. At Cambridge University he seems
to have written much and studied little, but that
little to good purpose. He inherited a modest fortune,
which he spent, not in riotous living, but in
travel, art study in Paris, and in the most risky of
all extravagances, the starting of new periodicals.
When this failed and his money was gone, he lived
in London as a hack-writer.</p>

<p>His young wife was taken from him by that saddest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of all bereavements—the loss of her mind. It
became necessary to place her in a private sanitarium,
where she outlived her husband by thirty
years. To her, and to the two little daughters whom
she left him, Thackeray was faithful and devoted.
He never complained, never flinched into an easy
way of escape from his burden. He bent his back
to it, and, in spite of natural indolence, he worked
hard and was cheerful.</p>

<p>He made a host of friends and kept them, as
Stevenson puts it, “without capitulation.” Of
course, this grim condition implies some frictions
and some dislikes, and from these Thackeray was
not exempt. The satire which was his first mode
in writing was too direct and pungent to be relished
by those who had any streak of self-humbug in
their make-up. But, so far as I know, he had only
one serious literary quarrel—that unhappy dispute
with Mr. Edmund Yates, in which Dickens, with
the best intentions in the world, became, unfortunately,
somewhat involved. Thackeray might
perhaps have been more generous and forgiving—he
could have afforded that luxury. But he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
have been more honest and frank, more real, than
he was. Being very angry, and for a just cause,
he said so in plain words. Presently the tempest
passed away. When Thackeray died in 1863, Dickens
wrote:</p>

<p>“No one can be surer than I of the greatness
and goodness of his heart.”</p>

<p>The first period of his life as a man of letters was
given almost entirely to satirical and fragmentary
writing, under various <i lang="fr">noms de guerre</i>. Hence, he
remained for a long time in comparative poverty
and obscurity, from which he stepped into fame and
prosperity with the publication of his first large
novel, <cite>Vanity Fair</cite>, in 1847-48. It was like turning
the corner of Grub Street and coming into Glory
Avenue.</p>

<p>Henceforth the way was open, though not easy.
The succession of his big, welcome novels was slow,
steady, unbroken. Each one brought him thousands
of new readers, and the old ones were <i lang="la">semper
fideles</i>, even when they professed a preference for
the earlier over the later volumes. His lecture tours
in Great Britain and the United States were eminently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
successful—more so, I think, than those of
Charles Dickens. They may have brought in less
money, but more of what old William Caxton, the
prince of printers, called “good fame and renommee.”
The last of his completed books, and
one of his most delightful, was <cite>Roundabout Papers</cite>—a
volume of essays that has no superior in English
for a light, firm, friendly touch upon the realities
of life. His last story begun was <cite>Denis Duval</cite>, and
on this he was working when he laid down his pen
on Christmas Eve, 1863, and fell asleep for the last
time.</p>

<p>It was Edmund Yates who wrote of him then:</p>

<p>“Thackeray was dead; and the purest English
prose writer of the nineteenth century and the novelist
with a greater knowledge of the human heart,
as it really is, than any other—with the exception
perhaps of Shakespeare and Balzac—was suddenly
struck down in the midst of us.”</p>

<p><em>The human heart as it really is</em>—there’s the point!
That is what Thackeray sought to know, to understand,
to reveal, and—no! not to explain, nor to
judge and sentence—for that, as he well knew, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
far beyond him or any of us—but his desire was to
<em>show</em> the real heart of man, in its various complexities
and perplexities, working its way through the
divers realities and unrealities in which we are all
entangled.</p>

<p>The acute French critic, Edmond Scherer, distinguished
and divided between George Eliot as “a
novelist of character,” and Thackeray as “a novelist
of manners.” The epithet will pass only if we
take the word in the sense of William of Wykeham’s
motto, “Manners makyth man.”</p>

<p>For, as surely as there is something in the outward
demeanour which unveils and discloses the
person within, even so surely is there something in
behaviour, the habitual mode of speech and conduct,
which moulds the man using it. A false behaviour
weaves a texture of lies into the warp of his nature.
A true behaviour weakens the hold of his own self-delusions,
and so helps him to know what he really
is—which is good for him and for others.</p>

<p>It was in this sense that Thackeray was interested
in manners, and depicted them in his books. Go
with him to a ball, and you arrive at the hour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
unmasking; to a club, and you are aware of the
thoughts under the conversation; to a play, and you
pass behind the footlights and the paint; to a death-bed,
and—well, do you remember the death of Helen
in <cite>Pendennis</cite>? and of the Colonel in <cite>The Newcomes</cite>?
Foolish critics speak of these last two passages as
“scenes.” Scenes! By Heaven! no, they are realities.
We can feel those pure souls passing.</p>

<p>Let us follow this clew of the passion for reality
through the three phases of Thackeray’s work.</p>

<p>At first he is the indefatigable satirist, rejoicing
in the assault. Youth is almost always inclined
that way—far more swift and sweeping in judgment,
more severe in condemnation, than maturity
or age. Thackeray writes much that is merely
amusing, full of high spirits and pure fun, in his
first period. But his main business is to expose
false pretensions, false methods, false principles in
literature and life; to show up the fakers, to ridicule
the humbugs, to convict the crooks of every rank
and degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, for example, is a popular fashion of books
with criminals and burglars for heroes and heroines,
portrayed in the glamour of romance. Very well,
our satirist, assuming the name of “Ikey Solomons,
Esq.,” will take a real criminal, a murderess, and
show us the manner of life she leads with her associates.
So we have <cite>Catherine</cite>. Here is another
fashion of weaving a fiction about a <i lang="fr">chevalier d’industrie</i>,
a bold, adventurous, conscienceless fellow
who pursues his own pleasure with a swagger, and
makes a brave show hide a mean and selfish heart.
Very well, a fellow of this kidney shall tell his own
story and show himself in his habit as he lives, and
as he dies in prison. So we have <cite>The Memoirs of
Barry Lyndon, Esq.</cite> Here are innumerable fashions
of folly and falsehood current not only in high society,
but also in the region of respectable mediocrity,
and in the “world below-stairs.” Very well,
our satirist, under the name of “Jeames Yellowplush,”
or “M. Angelo Titmarsh,” or “Fitz-Boodle,”
will show them up for us. So we have various
bundles of short stories, and skits, and sketches of
travel, some of them bubbling over with fun, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of them, like <cite>Dennis Haggarty’s Wife</cite>, touched with
quiet pathos.</p>

<p>The culmination of this satiric period is <cite>The Book
of Snobs</cite>, which appeared serially in the London
<cite>Punch</cite>, 1845-46. In order to understand the quality
and meaning of Thackeray’s satire—an element
which stayed with him all through his writing,
though it was later subdued to its proper place—we
must take the necessary pains to know just what
he meant by a “snob.”</p>

<p>A snob is an unreal person who tries to pass himself
off for a real person; a pretender who meanly
admires and imitates mean things; an ape of gentility.
He is a specific variety of the great genus
“Sham.” Carlyle, the other notable English satirist
of the nineteenth century, attacked the whole genus
with heavy artillery. Thackeray, with his light
cavalry of ridicule, assailed the species.</p>

<p>All snobs are shams, but not all shams are snobs.
The specific qualities of the snob are developed only
in countries where there are social classes and distinctions,
but no insuperable barriers between them.
Thus in native India with its immutable caste, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in Central Africa with its general barbarism, I fancy
it must be difficult to discover snobbism. (Yet I
have seen traces of it even among dogs and cats.)
But in a country like England or the United States
of America, where society is arranged in different
stories, with staircases between, snobbism is frequent
and flourishing.</p>

<p><em>The snob is the man who tries to sneak up-stairs.
He is the surreptitious climber, the person who is
ashamed to pass for what he is.</em></p>

<p>Has he been at an expensive college? He goes
home and snubs his old friends with allusions to
the distinguished society he has been keeping. Is
he entertaining fashionable strangers? He gives
them elaborate and costly fare at the most aurivorous
hotel, but at home his wife and daughters may
starve. He talks about books that he has never
read, and pretends to like music that sends him to
sleep. At his worst, he says his prayers on the
street-corners and reviles his neighbour for sins
which he himself cherishes in secret.</p>

<p>That is the snob: the particular species of sham
whom Thackeray pursues and satirizes through all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
his disguises and metamorphoses. He does it unsparingly,
yet never—or at least hardly ever—savagely.
There is always a strain of good humour
in it, and often a touch of fellow-feeling for the man
himself, camouflaged under his affectations. It may
not be worth while—this kind of work. All satire
is perishable. It has no more of the immortal in
it than the unreality which it aims to destroy. But
some shams die hard. And while they live and
propagate, the arrows which hit them fairly are not
out of date.</p>

<p>Stevenson makes a curious misjudgment of this
part of Thackeray’s work, when he says in his essay
on “Some Gentlemen in Fiction”:</p>

<p>“Personally [Thackeray] scarce appeals to us as
the ideal gentleman; if there were nothing else,
perpetual nosing after snobbery at least suggests
the snob.”</p>

<p>Most true, beloved R. L. S., but did you forget
that this is precisely what Thackeray himself says?
He tells us not to be too quick or absolute in our
judgments; to acknowledge that we have some
faults and failings of our own; to remember that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
other people have sometimes hinted at a vein, a
trace, a vestige of snobbery in ourselves. Search
for truth and speak it; but, above all, no arrogance—<i lang="fr">faut
pas monter sur ses grands chevaux</i>. Have
you ever read the end of the lecture on “Charity
and Humour”?</p>

<p>“The author ... has been described by <cite>The
London Times</cite> newspaper as a writer of considerable
parts, but a dreary misanthrope, who sees no good
anywhere, who sees the sky above him green, I
think, instead of blue, and only miserable sinners
around him. <em>So we are, as is every writer and reader
I have heard of; so was every being who ever trod this
earth, save One.</em> I cannot help telling the truth as
I view it, and describing what I see. To describe
it otherwise than it seems to me would be falsehood
in that calling in which it has pleased Heaven to
place me; treason to that conscience which says
that men are weak; that truth must be told; that
faults must be owned; that pardon must be prayed
for; and that Love reigns supreme over all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>With <cite>Vanity Fair</cite> begins what some one has called
the <em>quadrilateral</em> on which Thackeray’s larger fame
rests. The three other pillars are, <cite>Henry Esmond</cite>,
<cite>Pendennis</cite>, and <cite>The Newcomes</cite>. Which is the greatest
of these four novels? On this question there is
dispute among critics, and difference of opinion,
even among avowed Thackerayans, who confess that
they “like everything he wrote.” Why try to settle
the question? Why not let the interesting, illuminating
<i lang="fr">causerie</i> run on? In these furious days
when the hysteria of world-problems vexes us, it
is good to have some subjects on which we can dispute
without ranting or raving.</p>

<p>For my part, I find <cite>Vanity Fair</cite> the strongest,
<cite>Pendennis</cite> the most intimate, <cite>The Newcomes</cite> the
richest and in parts the most lovable, and <cite>Henry
Esmond</cite> the most admirable and satisfying, among
Thackeray’s novels. But they all have this in common:
they represent a reaction from certain false
fashions in fiction which prevailed at that time.
From the spurious romanticism of G. P. R. James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and Harrison Ainsworth, from the philosophic affectation
of Bulwer, from the gilding and rococo-work
of the super-snob Disraeli—all of them popular
writers of their day—Thackeray turned away,
not now as in his earlier period to satirize and ridicule
and parody them, but to create something in
a different <i lang="fr">genre</i>, closer to the facts of life, more
true to the reality of human nature.</p>

<p>We may read in the preface to <cite>Pendennis</cite> just
what he had in mind and purpose:</p>

<p>“Many ladies have remonstrated and subscribers
left me, because, in the course of the story, I described
a young man resisting and affected by temptation.
My object was to say, that he had the passions
to feel, and the manliness and generosity to
overcome them. You will not hear—it is best to
know it—what moves in the real world, what passes
in society, in the clubs, colleges, mess-rooms—what
is the life and talk of your sons. A little more frankness
than is customary has been attempted in this
story; with no bad desire on the author’s part, it is
hoped, and with no ill consequence to any reader.
If truth is not always pleasant, at any rate truth is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
best, from whatever chair—from those whence
graver writers or thinkers argue, as from that at
which the story-teller sits as he concludes his labour,
and bids his kind reader farewell.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="475" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY.</p>
<p class="caption-copy"><i>Reproduced from the Kensington Edition of Thackeray’s Works.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is amusing, in this age of art undressed, to
read this modest defense of frankness in fiction.
Its meaning is very different from the interpretation
of it which is given by disciples of the “show-everything-without-a-fig-leaf”
school.</p>

<p>Thackeray did not confuse reality with indecency.
He did not think it needful to make his hero cut his
toe-nails or take a bath in public in order to show
him as a real man. The ordinary and common
physical details of life may be taken for granted;
to obtrude them is to exaggerate their importance.
It is with the frailties and passions, the faults and
virtues, the defeats and victories of his men and
women that Thackeray deals. He describes Pendennis
tempted without making the description a
new temptation. He brings us acquainted with
Becky Sharp, <i lang="fr">enchanteresse</i>, without adding to her
enchantment. We feel that she is capable of anything;
but we do not know all that she actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
did,—indeed Thackeray himself frankly confessed
that even he did not know, nor much care.</p>

<p>The excellence of his character-drawing is that
his men and women are not mere pegs to hang a
doctrine or a theory on. They have a life of their
own, independent of, and yet closely touching his.
This is what he says of them in his essay “<cite>De Finibus</cite>”:</p>

<p>“They have been boarding and lodging with me
for twenty months.... I know the people utterly,—I
know the sound of their voices.”</p>

<p>Fault has been found with him (and that by such
high authority as Mr. Howells) for coming into his
own pages so often with personal comment or, “a
word to the reader.” It is said that this disturbs
the narrative, breaks the illusion, makes the novel
less convincing as a work of art. Frankly, it does
not strike me that way. On the contrary, it adds
to the verisimilitude. These men and women are
so real to him that he cannot help talking to us
about them as we go along together. Is it not just
so in actual life, when you go with a friend to watch
the passing show? Do you think that what Thackeray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
says to you about Colonel Newcome, or Captain
Costigan, or Helen Pendennis, or Laura, or
Ethel, or George Warrington, makes them fade
away?</p>

<p>Yes, I know the paragraphs at the beginning and
end of <cite>Vanity Fair</cite> about the showman and the
puppets and the box. But don’t you see what the
parable means? It is only what Shakespeare said
long ago:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">All the world’s a stage,</div>
<div class="verse">And all the men and women merely players.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nor would Thackeray have let this metaphor pass
without adding to it Pope’s fine line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Act well your part, there all the honour lies.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of course, there is another type of fiction in which
running personal comment by the author would be
out of place. It is illustrated in Dickens by <cite>A Tale
of Two Cities</cite>, and in Thackeray by <cite>Henry Esmond</cite>.
The latter seems to me the most perfect example
of a historical novel in all literature. More than
that,—it is, so far as I know, the best portrayal of
the character of a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The book presents itself as a memoir of Henry
Esmond, Esq., a colonel in the service of her Majesty,
Queen Anne, written by himself. Here, then,
we have an autobiographical novel, the most difficult
and perilous of all modes of fiction. If the
supposed author puts himself in the foreground, he
becomes egotistical and insufferable; if he puts
himself in the background, he becomes insignificant,
a mere Chinese “property-man” in the drama.
This dilemma Thackeray avoids by letting Esmond
tell his own story in the third person—that is to
say, with a certain detachment of view, such as a
sensible person would feel in looking back on his
own life.</p>

<p>Rarely is this historic method of narration broken.
I recall one instance, in the last chapter, where
Beatrix, after that tremendous scene in the house
of Castlewood with the Prince, reveals her true
nature and quits the room in a rage. The supposed
author writes:</p>

<p>“Her keen words gave no wound to Mr. Esmond;
his heart was too hard. As he looked at her, he
wondered that he could ever have loved her....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
The Prince blushed and bowed low, as she gazed
at him and quitted the chamber. <em>I have never seen
her from that day.</em>”</p>

<p>Thackeray made this slip on purpose. He wanted
us to feel the reality of the man who is trying to
tell his own story in the third person.</p>

<p>This, after all, is the real value of the book. It
is not only a wonderful picture of the Age of Queen
Anne, its ways and customs, its manner of speech
and life, its principal personages—the red-faced
queen, and peremptory Marlborough, and smooth
Atterbury, and rakish Mohun, and urbane Addison,
and soldier-scholar Richard Steele—appearing in the
background of the political plot. It is also, and
far more significantly, a story of the honour of
a gentleman—namely, Henry Esmond—carried
through a life of difficulty, and crowned with the
love of a true woman, after a false one had failed
him.</p>

<p>Some readers profess themselves disappointed
with the dénouement of the love-story. They find
it unnatural and disconcerting that the hero should
win the mother and not the daughter as the guerdon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of his devotion. Not I. Read the story more
closely.</p>

<p>When it opens, in the house of Castlewood, Esmond
is a grave, lonely boy of twelve; Lady Castlewood,
fair and golden-haired, is in the first bloom of
gracious beauty, twenty years old; Beatrix is a
dark little minx of four years. Naturally, Henry
falls in love with the mother rather than with the
daughter, grows up as her champion and knight,
defends her against the rakishness of Lord Mohun,
resolves for her sake to give up his claim to the title
and the estate. Then comes the episode of his infatuation
by the wonderful physical beauty of Beatrix,
the vixen. That madness ends with the self-betrayal
of her letter of assignation with the Prince,
and her subsequent conduct. Esmond returns to
his first love, his young love, his true love, Lady
Castlewood. Of its fruition let us read his own
estimate:</p>

<p>“That happiness which hath subsequently
crowned it, cannot be written in words; it is of its
nature sacred and secret, and not to be spoken of,
though the heart be ever so full of thankfulness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
save to Heaven and the One Ear alone—to one fond
being, the truest and tenderest and purest wife ever
man was blessed with.”</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>I have left myself scant space to speak of Thackeray’s
third phase in writing—his work as a moralist.
But perhaps this is well, for, as he himself said,
(and as I have always tried to practise), the preacher
must be brief if he wishes to be heard. Five words
that go home are worth more than a thousand that
wander about the subject.</p>

<p>Thackeray’s direct moralizings are to be found
chiefly in his lectures on “The Four Georges,” “The
English Humourists,” and in the “Roundabout
Papers.” He was like Lowell: as a scholastic critic
he was far from infallible, but as a vital interpreter
he seldom missed the mark.</p>

<p>After all, the essential thing in life for us as real
men is to have a knowledge of facts to correct our
follies, an ideal to guide our efforts, and a gospel
to sustain our hopes.</p>

<p>That was Thackeray’s message as moralist. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
is expressed in the last paragraph of his essay “<cite>Nil
Nisi Bonum</cite>,” written just after the death of Macaulay
and Washington Irving:</p>

<p>“If any young man of letters reads this little
sermon—and to him, indeed, it is addressed—I
would say to him, ‘Bear Scott’s words in your mind,
and <em>be good, my dear</em>.’ Here are two literary men
gone to their account, and, <i lang="la">laus Deo</i>, as far as we
know, it is fair, and open, and clean. Here is no
need of apologies for shortcomings, or explanations
of vices which would have been virtues but for unavoidable,
etc. Here are two examples of men most
differently gifted—each pursuing his calling; each
speaking his truth as God bade him; each honest
in his life; just and irreproachable in his dealings;
dear to his friends; honoured by his country; beloved
at his fireside. It has been the fortunate lot
of both to give incalculable happiness and delight
to the world, which thanks them in return with an
immense kindliness, respect, affection. It may not
be our chance, brother scribe, to be endowed with
such merit, or rewarded with such fame. But the
rewards of these men are rewards paid to <em>our service</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
We may not win the bâton or epaulettes; but God
give us strength to guard the honour of the flag!”</p>

<p>With this supplication for myself and for others,
I leave this essay on Thackeray, the greatest of
English novelists, to the consideration of real men.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>George Eliot was a woman who wrote full-grown
novels for men.</p>

<p>Other women have done and are doing notable
work in prose fiction—Jane Austen, George Sand,
Charlotte Brontë, Mrs. Stowe, Margaret Deland,
Edith Wharton, Katharine Fullerton Gerould, Mrs.
Humphry Ward—the list might easily be extended,
but it would delay us from the purpose of this
chapter. Let me rather make a general salute to
all the sisterhood who have risen above the indignity
of being called “authoresses,” and, without
pursuing perilous comparisons, go directly to the
subject in hand.</p>

<p>What was it that enabled George Eliot to enter
the field of the English novel at a time when Dickens
and Thackeray were at the height of their
fame, and win a place in the same class with them?</p>

<p>It was certainly not the hide-and-seek of the sex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of the new writer under a pseudonym. You remember,
opinions were divided on this question. Carlyle
and Thackeray thought that the author of
<cite>Scenes of Clerical Life</cite> was a man. Dickens was
sure that it was a woman. But a mystification of
this kind has no interest apart from the primary
value of the works of the unidentified writer in
question. Nor does it last long as an advertisement,
unless the following books excel the first;
and, in that case, the secret is sure to be soon discovered.</p>

<p>George Eliot’s success and distinction as a novelist
were due to three things: first, the preliminary
and rather obvious advantage of having genius;
second, a method of thinking and writing which is
commonly (though perhaps arrogantly) called masculine;
third, a quickness of insight into certain
things, a warmth of sympathy for suffering, and an
instinct of sacrifice which we still regard (we hope
rightly) as feminine. A man for logic, a woman for
feeling, a genius for creative power—that was a
great alliance. But the womanhood kept the priority
without which it would not only have died out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
but also have endangered, in dying, the other qualities.
Dickens was right when he said of certain
touches in the work of this pseudonymous writer:
“If they originated with no woman, I believe that
no man ever before had the art of making himself
mentally so like a woman since the world began.”</p>

<p>George Eliot’s profile resembled Savonarola’s.
He was one of her heroes. But she was not his
brother. She was his sister in the spirit.</p>

<p>Her essential femininity was the reason why the
drawing of her women surpassed the drawing of her
men. It was more intimate, more revealing, more
convincing. She knew women better. She painted
them of many types and classes—from the peasant
maid to the well-born lady, from the selfish white
cat to the generous white swan-sister; from the narrow-minded
Rosamund to the deep-hearted, broad-minded
Romola; all types, I think, but one—the
lewdly carnal Circe. In all her books, with perhaps a
single exception, it is a woman who stands out most
clearly from the carefully studied and often complex
background as the figure of interest. And even
in that one it is the slight form of Eppie, the golden-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
girl who was sent to save old Silas Marner
from melancholy madness, that shines brightest in
the picture.</p>

<p>The finest of her women—finest not in the sense
of being faultless, but of having in them most of
that wonderful sacrificial quality which Goethe called
<i lang="de">das ewig Weibliche</i>—were those upon whose spiritual
portraits George Eliot spent her most loving care
and her most graphic skill.</p>

<p>She shows them almost always in the revealing
light of love. But she does not dwell meticulously
on the symptoms or the course of the merely physical
attraction. She knows that it is there; she confesses
that it is potent. But it seems to her, (as indeed
it really is,) far more uniform and less interesting
than the meaning of love in the <em>soul</em> of a
woman as daughter, sister, sweetheart, wife. Were
it not for that inward significance there would be
little to differentiate the physical act from the mating
of the lower animals—an affair so common and
casual that it merits less attention than some writers
give it. But in the inner life of thought and emotion,
in a woman’s intellectual and moral nature,—there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
love has its mystery and its power, there it
brings deepest joy or sharpest sorrow, there it
strengthens or maims.</p>

<p>It is because George Eliot knows this and reveals
it with extraordinary clearness that her books have
an especial value. Other qualities they have, of
course, and very high qualities. But this is their
proper and peculiar excellence, and the source, if I
mistake not, of their strongest appeal to sanely
thinking men.</p>

<p><cite>The Man Who Understood Woman</cite> is the title of
a recent clever trivial story. But of course such a
man is a myth, an impostor, or a self-deluder. He
makes a preposterous claim.</p>

<p>Thackeray and Dickens, for example, made no
such pretension. Some of their women are admirably
drawn; they are very lovable, or very despicable,
as the case may be; but they are not completely
convincing. Thackeray comes nearer than Dickens,
and George Meredith, I think, much nearer than
either of the others. But in George Eliot we feel
that we are listening to one who does understand.
Her women, in their different types, reveal something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of that thinking, willing, feeling other-half of
humanity with whom man makes the journey of life.
They do not cover all the possibilities of variation
in the feminine, for these are infinite, but they are
real women, and so they have an interest for real
men.</p>

<p class="tb">Let us take it for granted that we know enough
of the details of George Eliot’s life to enable us to
understand and appreciate certain things in her
novels. Such biographical knowledge is illuminating
in the study of the works of any writer. The
author of a book is not an algebraic quantity nor a
strange monster, but a human being with certain
features and a certain life-history.</p>

<p>But, after all, the promotion of literary analysis
is not the object of these chapters. Plain reading,
and the pleasure of it, is what I have in mind. For
that cause I love most of George Eliot’s novels, and
am ready to maintain that they are worthy to be
loved. And so, even if my “taken for granted” a
few lines above should not be altogether accurate
in these days of ignorant contempt of all that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
“Victorian,” I may still go ahead to speak of her
books as they are in themselves: strong, fine, rewarding
pieces of English fiction: that is what they
would remain, no matter who had written them.</p>

<p>It must be admitted at once that they are not
adapted to readers who like to be spared the trouble
of thinking while they read. They do not belong to
the class of massage-fiction, Turkish-bath novels.
They require a certain amount of intellectual exercise;
and for this they return, it seems to me, an
adequate recompense in the pleasurable sense of
quickened mental activity and vigour.</p>

<p>But this admission must not be taken to imply
that they are obscure, intricate, enigmatical, “tough
reading,” like the later books of George Meredith
and Henry James, in which a minimum of meaning
is hidden in a maximum of obfuscated verbiage, and
the reader is invited to a tedious game of hunt-the-slipper.
On the contrary, George Eliot at her best
is a very clear writer—decidedly not shallow, nor
superficial, nor hasty,—like the running comment
which is supposed to illuminate the scenes in a
moving-picture show,—but intentionally lucid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
perspicuous. Having a story to tell, she takes pains
to tell it so that you can follow it, not only in its
outward, but also in its inward movement. Having
certain characters to depict (and almost always
mixed characters of good and evil mingled and conflicting
as in real life), she is careful to draw them so
that you shall feel their reality and take an interest
in their strifes and adventures.</p>

<p>They are distinctly persons, capable of making
their own choice between the worse and the better
reason, and thereafter influenced by the consequences
of that choice, which, if repeated, becomes
a habit of moral victory or defeat. They are not
puppets in, the hands of an inscrutable Fate, like
most of the figures in the books of the modern Russian
novelists and their imitators. What do I care
for the ever-so realistically painted marionettes in
the fiction of Messrs. Gawky, Popoff, Dropoff, and
Slumpoff? What interest have I in the minute articulations
of the dingy automatons of Mijnheer
Couperus, or the dismal, despicable figures who are
pulled through the pages of Mr. Samuel Butler’s
<cite>The Way of All Flesh</cite>? A claim on compassion they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
might have if they were alive. But being, by the
avowal of their creators, nothing more than imaginary
bundles of sensation, helpless playthings of
irresistible hereditary impulse and entangling destiny,
their story and their fate leave me cold.
What does it matter what becomes of them? They
can neither be saved nor damned. They can only
be drifted. There is no more human interest in
them than there is in the predestined saints and
foredoomed sinners of a certain type of Calvinistic
theology.</p>

<p>But this is not George Eliot’s view of life. It is
not to her “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound
and fury signifying nothing.” Within the fixed
circle of its stern natural and moral laws there is a
hidden field of conflict where the soul is free to discern
and choose its own cause, and to fight for it or
betray it. However small that field may be, while
it exists life has a meaning, and personalities are
real, and the results of their striving or surrendering,
though rarely seen complete or final, are worth following
and thinking about. Thus George Eliot’s
people—at least the majority of them—have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
human touch which justifies narrative and comment.
We follow the fortunes of Dinah Morris and
of Maggie Tulliver, of Romola, and of Dorothea
Brooke—yes, and of Hetty Sorrel and Rosamund
Vincy—precisely because we feel that they are real
women and that the turning of their ways will reveal
the secret of their hearts.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to think (as a recent admirable
essay of Professor W. L. Cross seems to imply) that
the books of George Eliot are characteristically
novels of argument or propaganda. Once only, or
perhaps twice, she yielded to that temptation and
spoiled her story. But for the rest she kept clear
of the snare of <i lang="de">Tendenz</i>.</p>

<p>Purpose-novels, like advertisements, belong in
the temporary department. As certain goods and
wares go out of date, and the often eloquent announcements
that commended them suddenly disappear;
even so the “burning questions” of the
hour and age burn out, and the solutions of them
presented in the form of fiction fall down with the
other ashes. They have served their purpose, well
or ill, and their transient importance is ended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
What endures, if anything, is the human story
vividly told, the human characters graphically depicted.
These have a permanent value. These belong
to literature. Here I would place <cite>Adam Bede</cite>
and <cite>Silas Marner</cite> and <cite>The Mill on the Floss</cite> and
<cite>Middlemarch</cite>, because they deal with problems
which never grow old; but not <cite>Robert Elsmere</cite>, because
it deals chiefly with a defunct controversy in
Biblical criticism.</p>

<p>George Eliot was thirty-eight years old when
she made the amazing discovery that she was by
nature, not what she had thought herself, a philosophical
essayist and a translator of arid German
treatises against revealed religion, but something
very different—a novelist of human souls, and especially
of the souls of women. It was the noteworthy
success of her three long short stories, <cite>Amos
Barton</cite>, <cite>Mr. Gilfil’s Love Story</cite>, and <cite>Janet’s Repentance</cite>,
printed in <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite> in 1857, that
revealed her to herself and to the world.</p>

<p>“Depend upon it, [she says to her imaginary
reader in the first of these stories,] you would gain
unspeakably if you would learn with me to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
something of the poetry and the pathos, the tragedy
and the comedy, lying in the experience of the
human soul that looks out through dull gray eyes
and speaks in a voice of quite ordinary tones.”</p>

<p>It was the interior drama of human life that attracted
her interest and moved her heart with pity
and fear, laughter and love. She found it for the
most part in what we should call mediocre surroundings
and on rather a humble and obscure stage.
But what she found was not mediocre. It was the
same discovery that Wordsworth made:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By this I do not mean to say that a close study of
the humanness of human nature, a searching contemplation
of character, an acute and penetrating
psychological analysis is all that there is in her
novels. This is her predominant interest, beyond a
doubt. She belongs to the school of Hawthorne,
Henry James, Thomas Hardy—realists or romancers
of the interior life. But she has other interests;
and there are other things to reward us in
the reading of her books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>There is, first of all, an admirable skill in the setting
of her stories. No other novelist has described
English midland landscape, towns, and hamlets,
better than she. No other writer has given the rich,
history-saturated scenery of Florence as well.</p>

<p>She is careful also not to exclude from her stage
that messenger of relief and contrast whom George
Meredith calls “the comic spirit.” Shakespeare’s
clowns, wonderful as some of them are, seem at
times like supernumeraries. They come in to make
a “diversion.” But George Eliot’s rustic wits and
conscious or unconscious humourists belong to the
story. Mrs. Poyser and Bartle Massey, Mrs. Glegg
and Mrs. Tulliver and Bob Jakin, could not be
spared.</p>

<p>And then, her stories are really stories. They
have action. They move; though sometimes, it
must be confessed, they move slowly. Not only do
the characters develop, one way or the other, but
the plot also develops. Sometimes it is very simple,
as in <cite>Silas Marner</cite>; sometimes it is extremely complicated,
as in <cite>Middlemarch</cite>, where three love-stories
are braided together. One thing it never is—theatrical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Yet at times it moves into an intense
scene, like the trial of Hetty Sorrel or the
death of Tito Melema, in which the very essence of
tragedy is concentrated.</p>

<p>From the success of <cite>Scenes of Clerical Life</cite> George
Eliot went on steadily with her work in fiction,
never turning aside, never pausing even, except
when her health compelled, or when she needed
time to fill her mind and heart with a new subject.
She did not write rapidly, nor are her books easy to
read in a hurry.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary series: <cite>Adam Bede</cite> in
1859, <cite>The Mill on the Floss</cite> in 1860, <cite>Silas Marner</cite> in
1861, <cite>Romola</cite> in 1863, <cite>Felix Holt, the Radical</cite> in 1866,
<cite>Middlemarch</cite> in 1871, <cite>Daniel Deronda</cite> in 1876; no
padding, no “seconds,” each book apparently more
successful, certainly more famous, than its predecessor.
How could one woman produce so much
closely wrought, finely finished work? Of what
sturdy mental race were the serious readers who
welcomed it and found delight in it?</p>

<p>Mr. Oscar Browning of Cambridge said that
<cite>Daniel Deronda</cite> was the climax, “the sun and glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of George Eliot’s art.” From that academic judgment
I venture to dissent. It is a great book, no
doubt, the work of a powerful intellect. But to
me it was at the first reading, and is still, a tiresome
book. Tediousness, which is a totally different
thing from seriousness, is the unpardonable
defect in a novel. It may be my own fault, but
Deronda seems to me something of a prig. Now a
man may be a prig without sin, but he ought not
to take up too much room. Deronda takes up too
much room. And Gwendolen Harleth, who dressed
by preference in sea-green, seems to me to have a
soul of the same colour—a psychological mermaid.
She is unconvincing. I cannot love her. The vivid
little Jewess, Mirah, is the only character with
charm in the book.</p>

<p><cite>Middlemarch</cite> is noteworthy for its extraordinary
richness of human observation and the unexcelled
truthfulness of some of its portraits. Mr. Isaac
Casaubon is the living image of the gray-minded
scholar and gentleman,—as delicately drawn as one
of Miss Cecelia Beaux’ portraits of aged, learned,
wrinkled men. Rosamund Vincy is the typical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
“daughter of the horse-leech” in respectable clothes
and surroundings. Dorothea Brooke is one of
George Eliot’s finest sacrificial heroines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A perfect woman, nobly plann’d.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The book, as a whole, seems to me to have the
defect of superabundance. There is too much of it.
It is like one of the late William Frith’s large canvases,
“The Derby Day,” or “The Railway Station.”
It is constructed with skill, and full of rich
material, but it does not compose. You cannot see
the people for the crowd. Yet there is hardly a
corner of the story in which you will not find something
worth while.</p>

<p><cite>Felix Holt, the Radical</cite> is marred, at least for me,
by a fault of another kind. It is a novel of problem,
of purpose. I do not care for problem-novels, unless
the problem is alive, and even then I do not care
very much for political economy in that form. It
is too easy for the author to prove any proposition
by attaching it to a noble character, or to disprove
any theory by giving it an unworthy advocate.
English radicalism of 1832 has quite passed away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
or gone into the Coalition Cabinet. All that saves
<cite>Felix Holt</cite> now (as it seems to me, who read novels
primarily for pleasure) is the lovely figure of Esther
Lyon, and her old father, a preacher who really was
good.</p>

<p>Following the path still backward, we come to
something altogether different. <cite>Romola</cite> is a historical
romance on the grand scale. In the central
background is the heroic figure of Savonarola,
saintly but not impeccable; in the middle distance,
a crowd of Renaissance people immersed in the rich
and bloody turmoil of that age; in the foreground,
the sharp contrast of two epic personalities—Tito
Melema, the incarnation of smooth, easy-going selfishness
which never refuses a pleasure nor accepts
a duty; and Romola, the splendid embodiment of
pure love in self-surrendering womanhood. The
shameful end of Tito, swept away by the flooded
river Arno and finally choked to death by the father
whom he had disowned and wronged, has in it the
sombre tone of Fate. But the end of the book is
not defeat; it is triumph. Romola, victor through
selfless courage and patience, saves and protects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the deserted mistress and children of her faithless
husband. In the epilogue we see her like <i lang="fr">Notre Dame
de Secours</i>, throned in mercy and crowned with
compassion.</p>

<p>Listen to her as she talks to Tito’s son in the
loggia looking over Florence to the heights beyond
Fiesole.</p>

<p>“‘What is it, Lillo?’ said Romola, pulling his
hair back from his brow. Lillo was a handsome lad,
but his features were turning out to be more massive
and less regular than his father’s. The blood
of the Tuscan peasant was in his veins.</p>

<p>“‘Mamma Romola, what am I to be?’ he said,
well contented that there was a prospect of talking
till it would be too late to con <i lang="it">Spirto gentil</i> any
longer.</p>

<p>“‘What should you like to be, Lillo? You might
be a scholar. My father was a scholar, you know,
and taught me a great deal. That is the reason why
I can teach you.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said Lillo, rather hesitatingly. ‘But he
is old and blind in the picture. Did he get a great
deal of glory?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Not much, Lillo. The world was not always
very kind to him, and he saw meaner men than
himself put into higher places, because they could
flatter and say what was false. And then his dear
son thought it right to leave him and become a
monk; and after that, my father, being blind and
lonely, felt unable to do the things that would have
made his learning of greater use to men, so that he
might still have lived in his works after he was in
his grave.’</p>

<p>“‘I should not like that sort of life,’ said Lillo.
‘I should like to be something that would make me
a great man, and very happy besides—something
that would not hinder me from having a good deal
of pleasure.’</p>

<p>“‘That is not easy, my Lillo. It is only a poor
sort of happiness that could ever come by caring
very much about our own narrow pleasures. We
can only have the highest happiness, such as goes
along with being a great man, by having wide
thoughts, and feeling for the rest of the world as
well as ourselves; and this sort of happiness often
brings so much pain with it, that we can only tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
it from pain by its being what we would choose
before everything else, because our souls see it is
good. There are so many things wrong and difficult
in the world, that no man can be great—he can
hardly keep himself from wickedness—unless he
gives up thinking much about pleasure or rewards,
and gets strength to endure what is hard and painful.
My father had the greatness that belongs to
integrity; he chose poverty and obscurity rather
than falsehood. And there was Fra Girolamo—you
know why I keep to-morrow sacred: <em>he</em> had the
greatness which belongs to a life spent in struggling
against powerful wrong, and in trying to raise men
to the highest deeds they are capable of. And so,
my Lillo, if you mean to act nobly and seek to know
the best things God has put within reach of men,
you must learn to fix your mind on that end, and
not on what will happen to you because of it. And
remember, if you were to choose something lower,
and make it the rule of your life to seek your own
pleasure and escape from what is disagreeable,
calamity might come just the same; and it would be
calamity falling on a base mind, which is the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
form of sorrow that has no balm in it, and that may
well make a man say, “It would have been better
for me if I had never been born.” I will tell you
something, Lillo.’</p>

<p>“Romola paused for a moment. She had taken
Lillo’s cheeks between her hands, and his young
eyes were meeting hers.</p>

<p>“‘There was a man to whom I was very near, so
that I could see a great deal of his life, who made
almost every one fond of him, for he was young,
and clever, and beautiful, and his manners to all
were gentle and kind. I believe, when I first knew
him, he never thought of anything cruel or base.
But because he tried to slip away from everything
that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so
much as his own safety, he came at last to commit
some of the basest deeds—such as make men infamous.
He denied his father, and left him to
misery; he betrayed every trust that was reposed
in him, that he might keep himself safe and get
rich and prosperous. Yet calamity overtook him.’</p>

<p>“Again Romola paused. Her voice was unsteady,
and Lillo was looking up at her with awed wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Another time, my Lillo—I will tell you another
time. See, there are our old Piero di Cosimo
and Nello coming up the Borgo Pinti, bringing us
their flowers. Let us go and wave our hands to
them, that they may know we see them.’”</p>

<p>Hardly one of George Eliot’s stories has a conventional
“happy ending.” Yet they leave us not depressed,
but strengthened to endure and invigorated
to endeavour. In this they differ absolutely
from the pessimistic novels of the present hour,
which not only leave a bad taste in the mouth, but
also a sense of futility in the heart.</p>

<p>Let me turn now to her first two novels, which
still seem to me her best. Bear in mind, I am not
formulating academic theories, nor pronouncing <i lang="la">ex
cathedrâ</i> judgments, but simply recording for the
consideration of other readers certain personal observations
and reactions.</p>

<p><cite>Adam Bede</cite> is a novel of rustic tragedy in which
some of the characters are drawn directly from
memory. Adam is a partial portrait of George
Eliot’s father, and Dinah Morris a sketch of her
aunt, a Methodist woman preacher. There is
plenty of comic relief in the story, admirably done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Take the tongue duel between Bartle Massey, the
sharp-spoken, kind-hearted bachelor school-master,
and Mrs. Poyser, the humorous, pungent, motherly
wife of the old farmer.</p>

<p>“‘What!’ said Bartle, with an air of disgust.
‘Was there a woman concerned? Then I give you
up, Adam.’</p>

<p>“‘But it’s a woman you’n spoke well on, Bartle,’
said Mr. Poyser. ‘Come, now, you canna draw
back; you said once as women wouldna ha’ been a
bad invention if they’d all been like Dinah.’</p>

<p>“‘I meant her voice, man—I meant her voice,
that was all,’ said Bartle. ‘I can bear to hear her
speak without wanting to put wool in my ears. As
for other things, I dare say she’s like the rest o’ the
women—thinks two and two ’ull come to make five,
if she cries and bothers enough about it.’</p>

<p>“‘Ay, ay!’ said Mrs. Poyser; ‘one ’ud think, an’
hear some folks talk, as the men war ’cute enough
to count the corns in a bag o’ wheat wi’ only smelling
at it. They can see through a barn door, <em>they</em>
can. Perhaps that’s the reason they can see so
little o’ this side on’t.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah!’ said Bartle, sneeringly, ‘the women are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
quick enough—they’re quick enough. They know
the rights of a story before they hear it, and can tell
a man what his thoughts are before he knows ’em
himself.’</p>

<p>“‘Like enough,’ said Mrs. Poyser; ‘for the men
are mostly so slow, their thoughts overrun ’em, an’
they can only catch ’em by the tail. I can count a
stocking-top while a man’s getting’s tongue ready;
an’ when he outs wi’ his speech at last, there’s little
broth to be made on’t. It’s your dead chicks take
the longest hatchin’. Howiver, I’m not denyin’ the
women are foolish: God Almighty made ’em to
match the men.’</p>

<p>“‘Match!’ said Bartle; ‘ay, as vinegar matches
one’s teeth. If a man says a word, his wife’ll
match it with a contradiction; if he’s a mind for
hot meat, his wife’ll match it with cold bacon; if he
laughs, she’ll match him with whimpering. She’s
such a match as the horsefly is to th’ horse: she’s
got the right venom to sting him with—the right
venom to sting him with.’</p>

<p>“‘What dost say to that?’ said Mr. Poyser,
throwing himself back and looking merrily at his
wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Say!’ answered Mrs. Poyser, with dangerous
fire kindling in her eye; ‘why, <em>I say as some folks’
tongues are like the clocks as run on strikin’, not to
tell you the time o’ the day, but because there’s summat
wrong i’ their own inside</em>.’ ...”</p>

<p>The plot, as in Scott’s <cite>Heart of Midlothian</cite>, turns
on a case of seduction and child murder, and the
contrast between Effie and Jeannie Deans has its
parallel in the stronger contrast between Hetty
Sorrel and Dinah Morris. Hetty looked as if she
were “made of roses”; but she was, in Mrs. Poyser’s
phrase, “no better nor a cherry wi’ a hard stone
inside it.” Dinah’s human beauty of face and voice
was the true reflection of her inward life which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">“cast a beam on the outward shape,</div>
<div class="verse">The unpolluted temple of the mind,</div>
<div class="verse">And turned it by degrees to the soul’s essence.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The crisis of the book comes in the prison, where
Dinah wrestles for the soul of Hetty—a scene as
passionate and moving as any in fiction. Dinah
triumphs, not by her own might, but by the sheer
power and beauty of the Christian faith and love
which she embodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>In George Eliot’s novels you will find some passages
of stinging and well-merited satire on the
semi-pagan, conventional religion of middle-class
orthodoxy in England of the nineteenth century—“proud
respectability in a gig of unfashionable
build; worldliness without side-dishes”—read the
chapter on “A Variation of Protestantism Unknown
to Bossuet,” in <cite>The Mill on the Floss</cite>. But
you will not find a single page or paragraph that
would draw or drive the reader away from real
Christianity. On the contrary, she has expressed
the very secret of its appeal to the human heart
through the words and conduct of some of her best
characters. They do not argue; they utter and show
the meaning of religion. On me the effect of her
books is a deepened sense of the inevitable need
of Christ and his gospel to sustain and nourish the
high morality of courage and compassion, patience,
and hope, which she so faithfully teaches.</p>

<p>The truth is, George Eliot lived in the afterglow
of Christian faith. Rare souls are capable of doing
that. But mankind at large needs the sunrise.</p>

<p><cite>The Mill on the Floss</cite> is partly an autobiographic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
romance. Maggie Tulliver’s character resembles
George Eliot in her youth. The contrast between
the practical and the ideal, the conflict between
love and duty in the heart of a girl, belong to those
<i lang="de">problematische Naturen</i>, as Goethe called them,
which may taste keen joys but cannot escape sharp
sorrows. The centre of the story lies in Maggie’s
strong devotion to her father and to her brother
Tom—a person not altogether unlike the “elder
brother” in the parable—in strife with her love for
Philip, the son of the family enemy. Tom ruthlessly
commands his sister to choose between breaking
with him and giving up her lover. Maggie,
after a bitter struggle, chooses her brother. Would
a real woman do that? Yes, I have known some
very real women who have done it, in one case with
a tragic result.</p>

<p>The original title of this book (and the right one)
was <cite>Sister Maggie</cite>. Yet we can see why George
Eliot chose the other name. The little river Floss,
so tranquil in its regular tidal flow, yet capable of
such fierce and sudden outbreaks, runs through the
book from beginning to end. It is a mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
type of the ineluctable power of Nature in man’s
mortal drama.</p>

<p>In the last chapter, when the flood comes, and
the erring sister who loved her brother so tenderly,
rescues him who loved her so cruelly from the ruined
mill, the frail skiff which carries them clasped heart
to heart, reconciled in that revealing moment, goes
down in the senseless irresistible rush of waters.</p>

<p>It is not a “bad ending.” The sister’s love triumphs.
Such a close was inevitable for such a
story. But it is not a conclusion. It cries out for
immortality.</p>

<p class="tb">On the art of George Eliot judgments have differed.
Mr. Oscar Browning, a respectable authority,
thinks highly of it. Mr. W. C. Brownell, a far
better critic, indeed one of the very best, thinks less
favourably of it, says that it is too intellectual;
that the development and conduct of her characters
are too logical and consistent; that the element
of surprize, which is always present in life, is
lacking in her people. “Our attention,” he writes,
“is so concentrated on what they think that we
hardly know how they feel, or whether ... they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
feel at all.” This criticism does not seem to me altogether
just. Certainly there is no lack of surprize
in Maggie Tulliver’s temporary infatuation with the
handsome, light-minded Stephen Guest, or in
Dorothea Brooke’s marriage to that heady young
butterfly, Will Ladislaw. These things certainly
were not arrived at by logical consistency. Nor can
one lay his hand on his heart and say that there is
no feeling in the chapter where the fugitive Romola
comes as Madonna to the mountain village, stricken
by pestilence, or in the passage where Dinah Morris
strives for Hetty’s soul in prison.</p>

<p>George Eliot herself tells us the purpose of her
art—it is <em>verity</em>.</p>

<p>“It is for this rare, precious quality of truthfulness
that I delight in many Dutch paintings, which
lofty-minded people despise.... All honour and
reverence to the divine beauty of form! Let us
cultivate it to the utmost in men, women, and
children—in our gardens and in our homes. But
let us love that other beauty, too, which lies in no
secret of proportion, but in the secret of deep human
sympathy.”</p>

<p>It is Rembrandt, then, rather than Titian, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
is her chosen painter. But she does not often attain
his marvellous <i lang="it">chiaroscuro</i>.</p>

<p>Her style is clear and almost always firm in
drawing, though deficient in colour. It is full of
meaning, almost over-scrupulous in defining precisely
what she wishes to express. Here and there
it flashes into a wise saying, a sparkling epigram.
At other times, especially in her later books, it
spreads out and becomes too diffuse, too slow, like
Sir Walter Scott’s. But it never repels by vulgar
smartness, nor perplexes by vagueness and artificial
obscurity. It serves her purpose well—to
convey the results of her scrutiny of the inner life
and her loving observation of the outer life in its
humblest forms. In these respects it is admirable
and satisfying. And it is her own—she does not
imitate, nor write according to a theory.</p>

<p>Her general view of human nature is not essentially
different from that expressed in a passage
which I quoted from Thackeray in the previous
chapter. We are none of us “irreproachable characters.”
We are “mixed human beings.” Therefore
she wishes to tell her stories “in such a way as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to call forth tolerant judgment, pity, and sympathy.”</p>

<p class="tb">As I began so let me end this chapter—with a
word on women. For myself, I think it wise and
prudent to maintain with Plutarch that <em>virtue</em> in
man and woman is one and the same. Yet there is
a difference between the feminine and the masculine
virtues. This opinion Plutarch sets forth and illustrates
in his brief histories, and George Eliot in her
novels. But of the virtues of women she gives
more and finer examples.</p>

old Colonel Newcome when he gathered his boy’s
friends around the mahogany tree in the dull, respectable
dining-room at 12 Fitzroy Square, was to
hear George Warrington declare, between huge
puffs of tobacco smoke, “that young Keats was a
genius to be estimated in future days with young
Raphael.” At this Charles Honeyman sagely
nodded his ambrosial head, while Clive Newcome
assented with sparkling eyes. But to the Colonel,
sitting kindly grave and silent at the head of the
table, and recalling (somewhat dimly) the bewigged
and powdered poetry of the age of Queen Anne,
such a critical sentiment seemed radical and revolutionary,
almost ungentlemanly.</p>

<p>How astonished he would have been sixty years
later if he had taken up Mr. Sidney Colvin’s <cite>Life of
Keats</cite>, in the “English Men of Letters Series,” and
read in the concluding chapter the deliberate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
remarkable judgment that “by power, as well as
by temperament and aim, he was the most Shakespearean
spirit that has lived since Shakespeare”!</p>

<p>In truth, from the beginning the poetry of Keats
has been visited too much by thunder-storms of
praise. It was the indiscriminate enthusiasm of his
friends that drew out the equally indiscriminate
ridicule of his enemies. It was the premature salutation
offered to him as a supreme master of the
most difficult of all arts that gave point and sting
to the criticism of evident defects in his work. <cite>The
Examiner</cite> hailed him, before his first volume had
been printed, as one who was destined to revive
the early vigour of English poetry. <cite>Blackwood’s
Magazine</cite> retorted by quoting his feeblest lines and
calling him “Johnny Keats.” The suspicion of
log-rolling led to its usual result in a volley of stone-throwing.</p>

<p>Happily, the ultimate fame and influence of a
true poet are not determined by the partizan conflicts
which are waged about his name. He may
suffer some personal loss by having to breathe, at
times, a perturbed atmosphere of mingled flattery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and abuse instead of the still air of delightful studies.
He may be robbed of some days of a life already
far too short, by the pestilent noise and
confusion arising from that scramble for notoriety
which is often unduly honoured with the name of
“literary activity.” And there are some men whose
days of real inspiration are so few, and whose poetic
gift is so slender, that this loss proves fatal to them.
They are completely carried away and absorbed by
the speculations and strifes of the market-place.
They spend their time in the intrigues of rival poetic
enterprises, and learn to regard current quotations
in the trade journals as the only standard of value.
Minor poets at the outset, they are tempted to risk
their little all on the stock exchange of literature,
and, losing their last title to the noun, retire to bankruptcy
on the adjective.</p>

<p>But Keats did not belong to this frail and foolish
race. His lot was cast in a world of petty conflict
and ungenerous rivalry, but he was not of that
world. It hurt him a little, but it did not ruin him.
His spiritual capital was too large, and he regarded
it as too sacred to be imperilled by vain speculations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
He had in Chaucer and Spenser, Shakespeare and
Chapman, Milton and Petrarch, older and wiser
friends than Leigh Hunt. For him</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent13">“The blue</div>
<div class="verse">Bared its eternal bosom, and the dew</div>
<div class="verse">Of summer nights collected still to make</div>
<div class="verse">The morning precious: beauty was awake!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He perceived, by that light which comes only to
high-souled and noble-hearted poets,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“The great end</div>
<div class="verse">Of poesy, that it should be a friend</div>
<div class="verse">To soothe the cares and lift the thoughts of man.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To that end he gave the best that he had to give,
freely, generously, joyously pouring himself into
the ministry of his art. He did not dream for a
moment that the gift was perfect. Flattery could
not blind him to the limitations and defects of his
early work. He was his own best and clearest critic.
But he knew that so far as it went his poetic inspiration
was true. He had faithfully followed the
light of a pure and elevating joy in the opulent,
manifold beauty of nature and in the eloquent significance
of old-world legends, and he believed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
it had already led him to a place among the poets
whose verse would bring delight, in far-off years,
to the sons and daughters of mankind. He believed
also that if he kept alive his faith in the truth of
beauty and the beauty of truth it would lead him
on yet further, into a nobler life and closer to those
immortal bards whose</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“Souls still speak</div>
<div class="verse">To mortals of their little week;</div>
<div class="verse">Of their sorrows and delights;</div>
<div class="verse">Of their passions and their spites;</div>
<div class="verse">Of their glory and their shame;</div>
<div class="verse">What doth strengthen and what maim.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He expressed this faith very clearly in the early
and uneven poem called “Sleep and Poetry,” in
a passage which begins</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh, for ten years, that I may overwhelm</div>
<div class="verse">Myself in poesy! so I may do the deed</div>
<div class="verse">That my own soul has to itself decreed.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And then, ere four years had followed that brave
wish, his voice fell silent under a wasting agony of
pain and love, and the daisies were growing upon
his Roman grave.</p>

<p>The pathos of his frustrated hope, his early death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
has sometimes blinded men a little, it seems to me,
to the real significance of his work and the true
quality of his influence in poetry. He has been
lamented in the golden verse of Shelley’s “Adonaïs,”
and in the prose of a hundred writers who have
shared Shelley’s error without partaking of his
genius, as the loveliest innocent ever martyred by
the cruelty of hostile critics. But, in fact, the vituperations
of Gifford and his crew were no more
responsible for the death of Keats, than the stings
of insects are for the death of a man who has
perished of hunger on the coast of Labrador. They
added to his sufferings, no doubt, but they did not
take away his life. Keats had far too much virtue
in the old Roman sense—far too much courage, to
be killed by a criticism. He died of consumption,
as he clearly and sadly knew that he was fated to
do when he first saw the drop of arterial blood upon
his pillow.</p>

<p>Nor is it just, although it may seem generous, to
estimate his fame chiefly by the anticipation of
what he might have accomplished if he had lived
longer; to praise him for his promise at the expense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of his performance; and to rest his claim to a place
among the English poets upon an uncertain prophecy
of rivalry with Shakespeare. I find a far sounder
note in Lowell’s manly essay, when he says: “No
doubt there is something tropical and of strange
overgrowth in his sudden maturity, but it <em>was</em> maturity
nevertheless.” I hear the accent of a wiser
and saner criticism in the sonnet of one of our American
poets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Touch not with dark regret his perfect fame,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Sighing, ‘Had he but lived he had done so’;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Or, ‘Were his heart not eaten out with woe</div>
<div class="verse">John Keats had won a prouder, mightier name!’</div>
<div class="verse">Take him for what he was and did—nor blame</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Blind fate for all he suffered. Thou shouldst know</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Souls such as his escape no mortal blow—</div>
<div class="verse">No agony of joy, or sorrow, or shame.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Take him for what he was and did”—that
should be the key-note of our thought of Keats as
a poet. The exquisite harmony of his actual work
with his actual character; the truth of what he
wrote to what his young heart saw and felt and
enjoyed; the simplicity of his very exuberance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
ornament, and the naturalness of his artifice; the
sincerity of his love of beauty and the beauty of his
sincerity—these are the qualities which give an individual
and lasting charm to his poetry, and make
his gift to the world complete in itself and very
precious, although,—or perhaps we should even say
because,—it was unfinished.</p>

<p>Youth itself is imperfect: it is impulsive, visionary,
and unrestrained; full of tremulous delight
in its sensations, but not yet thoroughly
awake to the deeper meanings of the world; avid
of novelty and mystery, but not yet fully capable
of hearing or interpreting the still, small voice of
divine significance which breathes from the simple
and familiar elements of life.</p>

<p>Yet youth has its own completeness as a season
of man’s existence. It is justified and indispensable.
Alfred de Musset’s</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“We old men born yesterday”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">are simply monstrous. The poetry which expresses
and represents youth, the poetry of sensation and
sentiment, has its own place in the literature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
world. This is the order to which the poetry of
Keats belongs.</p>

<p>He is not a feminine poet, as Mr. Coventry Patmore
calls him, any more than Theocritus or
Tennyson is feminine; for the quality of extreme
sensitiveness to outward beauty is not a mark of
femininity. It is found in men more often and more
clearly than in women. But it is always most keen
and joyous and overmastering in the morning of
the soul.</p>

<p>Keats is not a virile poet, like Dante or Shakespeare
or Milton; that he would have become one
if he had lived is a happy and loving guess. He is
certainly not a member of the senile school of poetry,
which celebrates the impotent and morbid passions
of decay, with a <i lang="fr">café chantant</i> for its temple, and
the smoke of cigarettes for incense, and cups of
absinthe for its libations, and for its goddess not
the immortal Venus rising from the sea, but the
weary, painted, and decrepit Venus sinking into the
gutter.</p>

<p>He is in the highest and best sense of the word
a juvenile poet—“mature,” as Lowell says, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
mature, as genius always is, within the boundaries
and in the spirit of his own season of life. The very
sadness of his lovely odes, “To a Nightingale,”
“On a Grecian Urn,” “To Autumn,” “To Psyche,”
is the pleasant melancholy of the springtime of the
heart. “The Eve of St. Agnes,” pure and passionate,
surprizing us by its fine excess of colour and
melody, sensuous in every line, yet free from the
slightest taint of sensuality, is unforgettable and
unsurpassable as the dream of first love. The poetry
of Keats, small in bulk and slight in body as it seems
at first sight to be, endures, and will endure, in English
literature, because it is the embodiment of <em>the
spirit of immortal youth</em>.</p>

<p>Here, I think, we touch its secret as an influence
upon other poets. For that it has been an influence,—in
the older sense of the word, which carries with
it a reference to the guiding and controlling force
supposed to flow from the stars to the earth,—is beyond
all doubt. The <cite>History of English Literature</cite>,
with which Taine amused us some fifty years ago,
nowhere displays its narrowness of vision more egregiously
than in its failure to take account of Gray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Collins, and Keats as fashioners of English poetry.
It does not mention Gray and Collins at all; the
name of Keats occurs only once, with a reference
to “sickly or overflowing imagination,” but to Byron
nearly fifty pages are devoted. The American critic,
Stedman, showed a far broader and more intelligent
understanding of the subject when he said that
“Wordsworth begot the mind, and Keats the body,
of the idyllic Victorian School.”</p>

<p>We can trace the influence of Keats not merely
in the conscious or unconscious imitations of his
manner, like those which are so evident in the early
poems of Tennyson and Procter, in Hood’s <cite>Plea
of the Midsummer Fairies</cite> and <cite>Lycus the Centaur</cite>,
in Rossetti’s <cite>Ballads and Sonnets</cite>, and William
Morris’s <cite>Earthly Paradise</cite>, but also in the youthful
spirit of delight in the retelling of old tales of
mythology and chivalry; in the quickened sense
of pleasure in the luxuriance and abundance of
natural beauty; in the freedom of overflowing
cadences transmuting ancient forms of verse into
new and more flexible measures; in the large liberty
of imaginative diction, making all nature sympathize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with the joy and sorrow of man,—in brief,
in many of the finest marks of a renascence, a renewed youth,
which characterize the poetry of the
early Victorian era.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that Keats alone, or chiefly,
was responsible for this renascence. He never set
up to lead a movement or to found a school. His
genius is not to be compared to that of a commanding
artist like Giotto or Leonardo or Michelangelo,
but rather to that of a painter like Botticelli, whose
personal and expressive charm makes itself felt in
the work of many painters, who learned secrets of
grace and beauty from him, though they were not
his professed disciples or followers.</p>

<p>Take for example Matthew Arnold. He called
himself, and no doubt rightly, a Wordsworthian.
But it was not from Wordsworth that he caught
the strange and searching melody of “The Forsaken
Merman,” or learned to embroider the laments for
“Thyrsis” and “The Scholar-Gypsy” with such
opulence of varied bloom as makes death itself seem
lovely. It was from John Keats. Or read the description
of the tapestry on the castle walls in “Tristram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and Iseult.” How perfectly that repeats the
spirit of Keats’s descriptions in “The Eve of St.
Agnes”! It is the poetry of the picturesque.</p>

<p>Indeed, we shall fail to do justice to the influence
of Keats unless we recognize also that it has produced
direct and distinct effects in the art of painting.
The English pre-Raphaelites owed much to his
inspiration. Holman Hunt found two of his earliest
subjects for pictures in “The Eve of St. Agnes”
and “The Pot of Basil.” Millais painted “Lorenzo
and Isabella,” and Rossetti “La Belle Dame sans
Merci.” There is an evident sympathy between
the art of these painters, which insisted that every
detail in a picture is precious and should be painted
with truthful care for its beauty, and the poetry of
Keats, which is filled, and even overfilled, with
minute and loving touches of exquisite elaboration.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that in poetry, as
well as in painting, the spirit of picturesqueness has
its dangers. The details may be multiplied until
the original design is lost. The harmony and
lucidity of a poem may be destroyed by innumerable
digressions and descriptions. In some of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
poems—in “Endymion” and in “Lamia”—Keats
fell very deep into this fault, and no one knew it
better than himself. But when he was at his best
he had the power of adding a hundred delicate details
to his central vision, and making every touch
heighten and enhance the general effect. How
wonderful in its unity is the “Ode on a Grecian
Urn”! How completely magical are the opening
lines of “Hyperion”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Deep in the shady sadness of a vale</div>
<div class="verse">Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,</div>
<div class="verse">Far from the fiery Noon, and eve’s one star,</div>
<div class="verse">Sat gray-hair’d Saturn, quiet as a stone,</div>
<div class="verse">Still as the silence round about his lair;</div>
<div class="verse">Forest on forest hung about his head</div>
<div class="verse">Like cloud on cloud.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">How large and splendid is the imagery of the sonnet
“On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer”!
And who that has any sense of poetry does not recognize
the voice of a young master in the two superb
lines of the last poem that Keats wrote?—the sonnet
in which he speaks of the bright star</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent3">“watching, with eternal lids apart,</div>
<div class="verse">Like Nature’s patient, sleepless Eremite,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<div class="verse">The moving waters at their priestlike task</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The poets of America have not been slow to recognize
the charm and power of Keats. Holmes and
Longfellow and Lowell paid homage to him in their
verse. Lanier inscribed to his memory a poem
called “Clover.” Gilder wrote two sonnets which
celebrate his “perfect fame.” Robert Underwood
Johnson has a lovely lyric on “The Name Writ in
Water.”</p>

<p>But I find an even deeper and larger tribute to
his influence in the features of resemblance to his
manner and spirit which flash out here and there,
unexpectedly and unconsciously, in the poetry of
our New World. Emerson was so unlike Keats in
his intellectual constitution as to make all contact
between them appear improbable, if not impossible.
Yet no one can read Emerson’s “May-Day,” and
Keats’ exquisitely truthful and imaginative lines
on “Fancy,” one after the other, without feeling
that the two poems are very near of kin. Lowell’s
“Legend of Brittany” has caught, not only the
measure, but also the tone and the diction of “Isabella.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
The famous introduction to “The Vision
of Sir Launfal,” with its often quoted line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What is so rare as a day in June?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">finds a parallel in the opening verses of “Sleep and
Poetry”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“What is more gentle than a wind in summer?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Lowell’s “Endymion,” which he calls “a mystical
comment on Titian’s ‘Sacred and Profane Love,’”
is full of echoes from Keats, like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“My day began not till the twilight fell</div>
<div class="verse">And lo! in ether from heaven’s sweetest well</div>
<div class="verse">The new moon swam, divinely isolate</div>
<div class="verse">In maiden silence, she that makes my fate</div>
<div class="verse">Haply not knowing it, or only so</div>
<div class="verse">As I the secrets of my sheep may know.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In Lanier’s rich and melodious “Hymns of the
Marshes” there are innumerable touches in the style
of Keats; for example, his apostrophe to the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Reverend marsh, low-couched along the sea,</div>
<div class="verse">Old chemist, wrapped in alchemy,</div>
<div class="verse">Distilling silence,——”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">or his praise of the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Beautiful glooms, soft dusks in the noon-day fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Wildwood privacies, closets of lone desire,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Chamber from chamber parted with wavering arras of leaves.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">One of the finest pieces of elegiac verse that have
yet been produced in America, George E. Woodberry’s
poem called “The North Shore Watch,” has
many passages that recall the young poet who wrote</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A thing of beauty is a joy forever.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Indeed, we hear the very spirit of Endymion speaking
in Woodberry’s lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Beauty abides, nor suffers mortal change,</div>
<div class="verse">Eternal refuge of the orphaned mind.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Father John B. Tabb, who had the exquisite art of
the Greek epigram at his command, in one of his
delicately finished little poems, imagined Sappho
listening to the “Ode to a Nightingale”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Methinks when first the nightingale</div>
<div class="verse">Was mated to thy deathless song,</div>
<div class="verse">That Sappho with emotion pale</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Amid the Olympian throng,</div>
<div class="verse">Again, as in the Lesbian grove,</div>
<div class="verse">Stood listening with lips apart,</div>
<div class="verse">To hear in thy melodious love</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The pantings of her heart.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes; the memory and influence of Keats endure,
and will endure, because his poetry expresses something
in the heart that will not die so long as there
are young men and maidens to see and feel the
beauty of the world and the thrill of love. His poetry
is complete, it is true, it is justified, because it
is the fitting utterance of one of those periods of
mental life which Keats himself has called “the
human seasons.”</p>

<p>But its completeness and its truth depend upon
its relation, in itself and in the poet’s mind, to the
larger world of poetry, the fuller life, the rounded
year of man. Nor was this forward look, this anticipation
of something better and greater yet to come,
lacking in the youth of Keats. It flashes out, again
and again, from his letters, those outpourings of his
heart and mind, so full of boyish exuberance and
manly vigour, so rich in revelations of what this marvellous,
beautiful, sensitive, courageous little creature
really was,—a great soul in the body of a lad.
It shows itself clearly and calmly in the remarkable
preface in which he criticizes his own “Endymion,”
calling it “a feverish attempt, rather than a deed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
accomplished.” “It is just,” he writes, “that this
youngster should die away: a sad thought for me,
if I had not some hope that while it is dwindling I
may be plotting, and fitting myself for verses fit
to live.” The same fine hope of a sane and manly
youth is expressed in his early verses entitled “Sleep
and Poetry.” He has been speaking of the first
joys of his fancy, in the realm of Flora and old Pan:
the merry games and dances with white-handed
nymphs: the ardent pursuit of love, and the satisfied
repose in the bosom of a leafy world. Then his
imagination goes on to something better.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And can I ever bid these joys farewell?</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, I must pass them for a nobler life,</div>

<div class="verse">O’ersailing the blue cragginess, a car</div>

<div class="verse">Passing along before a dusky space</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Made by some mighty oaks: as they would chase</div>
<div class="verse">Some ever-fleeting music, on they sweep.</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep:</div>
<div class="verse">Some with upholden hand and mouth severe;</div>
<div class="verse">Some with their faces muffled to the ear</div>
<div class="verse">Between their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom,</div>
<div class="verse">Go glad and smilingly across the gloom;</div>
<div class="verse">Some looking back, and some with upward gaze;</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, thousands in a thousand different ways</div>
<div class="verse">Flit onward—now a lovely wreath of girls</div>
<div class="verse">Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls;</div>
<div class="verse">And now broad wings. Most awfully intent</div>
<div class="verse">The driver of those steeds is forward bent,</div>
<div class="verse">And seems to listen: O that I might know</div>
<div class="verse">All that he writes with such a hurrying glow.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The visions all are fled—the car is fled</div>
<div class="verse">Into the light of heaven, and in their stead</div>
<div class="verse">A sense of real things comes doubly strong,</div>
<div class="verse">And, like a muddy stream, would bear along</div>
<div class="verse">My soul to nothingness: but I will strive</div>
<div class="verse">Against all doubtings, and will keep alive</div>
<div class="verse">The thought of that same chariot, and the strange</div>
<div class="verse">Journey it went.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How young-hearted is this vision, how full of
thronging fancies and half-apprehended mystic
meanings! Yet how unmistakably it has the long,
high, forward look toward manhood, without which
youth itself is not rounded and complete!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, that look, that brave expectation, is vital
in our picture of Keats. It is one of the reasons
why we love him. It is one of the things which
make his slender volume of poetry so companionable,
even as an ardent, dreamy man is doubly a good
comrade when we feel in him the hope of a strong
man. We cannot truly understand the wonderful
performance of Keats without considering his promise;
we cannot appreciate what he did without remembering
that it was only part of what he hoped
to do.</p>

<p>He was not one of those who believe that the
ultimate aim of poetry is sensuous loveliness, and
that there is no higher law above the law of “art
for art’s sake.” The poets of arrested development,
the artificers of mere melody and form, who say
that art must always play and never teach, the
musicians who are content to remain forever</p>

<p>When this essay was written, a good many years
ago, there was no available biography of Wordsworth
except the two-volume <cite>Memoir</cite> by Bishop
Christopher Wordsworth, the poet’s nephew. It is
a solid work of family piety, admiring and admirable;
but it must be admitted that it is dull. It
is full of matters of no particular consequence, and
it leaves out events in the poet’s life and traits in
his character which are not only interesting in
themselves but also of real importance to a vital
understanding of his work.</p>

<p>Even while reading the <cite>Memoir</cite>, I felt sure that
he was not always the tranquil, patient, wise, serenely
happy sage that he appeared in his later
years,—sure that a joy in peace as deep and strong
as his was, could only have been won through sharp
conflict,—sure that the smooth portrait drawn by
the reverent hand of the bishop did not fully and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
frankly depict the real man who wrote the deep
and moving poetry of Wordsworth.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the valuable studies
of Wordsworth’s early life which had been made
by Professor Emile Legouis, (then of the University
of Lyons, now of the Sorbonne,) were published in
English. This volume threw a new light upon the
poet’s nature, revealing its intense, romantic strain,
and making clear at least some of the causes which
led to the shipwreck of his first hopes and to the
period of profound gloom which followed his return
from residence in France in December 1792.</p>

<p>Shortly after reading Professor Legouis’ book, I
met by chance a gentleman in Baltimore and was
convinced by what he told me, (in a conversation
which I do not feel at liberty to repeat in detail,)
that Wordsworth had a grand “affair of the heart”
while he lived in France, with a young French lady
of excellent family and character. But they were
parted. A daughter was born, (whom he legitimated
according to French law,) and descendants
of that daughter were living.</p>

<p>There was therefore solid ground for my feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
that the poet was not a man who had been always
and easily decorous. He had passed through a time
of storm and stress. He had lost not only his political
dreams and his hopes of a career, but also his
first love and his joy. The knowledge of this gave
his poetry a new meaning for me, brought it nearer,
made it seem more deeply human. It was under
the influence of this feeling that this essay was
written in a farmhouse in Tyringham Valley, where
I was staying in the winter of 1897, with Richard
Watson Gilder and his wife.</p>

<p>Since then Professor George McLean Harper has
completed and published, (1916,) his classic book
on <cite>William Wordsworth, His Life, Works, and Influence</cite>.
This is undoubtedly the very best biography
of the poet, and it contains much new material,
particularly with reference to his life and connections
in France. But there is nothing in it to shake,
and on the contrary there is much to confirm, the
opinion which was first put forth in this essay:
namely, that the central theme, the great significance,
of Wordsworth’s poetry is <em>the recovery of joy</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>William Wordsworth was born in 1770 in the
town of Cockermouth in Cumberland; educated
in the village school of Hawkshead among the mountains,
and at St. John’s College, Cambridge. A
dreamy, moody youth; always ambitious, but not
always industrious; passionate in disposition, with
high spirits, simple tastes, and independent virtues;
he did not win, and seems not to have desired,
university honours. His principal property when he
came of age consisted of two manuscript poems,—<cite>An
Evening Walk</cite> and <cite>Descriptive Sketches</cite>,—composed
in the manner of Cowper’s <cite>Task</cite>. With these
in his pocket he wandered over to France; partly
to study the language; partly to indulge his inborn
love of travel by a second journey on the Continent;
and partly to look on at the vivid scenes of the
French Revolution. But the vast dæmonic movement
of which he proposed to be a spectator caught
his mind in its current and swept him out of his
former self.</p>

<p>Wordsworth was not originally a revolutionist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
like Coleridge and Southey. He was not even a
native radical, except as all simplicity and austerity
of character tend towards radicalism. When he
passed through Paris, in November of 1791, and
picked up a bit of stone from the ruins of the Bastile
as a souvenir, it was only a sign of youthful
sentimentality. But when he came back to Paris
in October of 1792, after a winter at Orleans and a
summer at Blois, in close intercourse with that
ardent and noble republican, Michael Beaupuy,
he had been converted into an eager partisan of the
Republic. He even dreamed of throwing himself
into the conflict, reflecting on “the power of one
pure and energetic will to accomplish great things.”</p>

<p>His conversion was not, it seems to me, primarily
a matter of intellectual conviction. It was an affair
of emotional sympathy. His knowledge of the
political and social theories of the Revolution was
but superficial. He was never a doctrinaire. The
influence of Rousseau and Condorcet did not penetrate
far beneath the skin of his mind. It was the
primal joy of the Revolutionary movement that
fascinated him,—the confused glimmering of new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
hopes and aspirations for mankind. He was like
a man who has journeyed, half asleep, from the
frost-bound dulness of a wintry clime, and finds
himself, fully awake, in a new country, where the
time for the singing of birds has come, and the multitudinous
blossoming of spring bursts forth. He
is possessed by the spirit of joy, and reason follows
where feeling leads the way. Wordsworth himself
has confessed, half unconsciously, the secret of his
conversion in his lines on <cite>The French Revolution
as it appeared to Enthusiasts at its Commencement</cite>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy!</div>
<div class="verse">For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood</div>
<div class="verse">Upon our side, we who were strong in love!</div>
<div class="verse">Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,</div>
<div class="verse">But to be young was very heaven!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was another “bliss,” keener even than the
dreams of political enthusiasm, that thrilled him in
this momentous year,—the rapture of romantic
love. Into this he threw himself with ardour and
tasted all its joy. We do not know exactly what it
was that broke the vision and dashed the cup of
gladness from his lips. Perhaps it was some difficulty
with the girl’s family, who were royalists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Perhaps it was simply the poet’s poverty. Whatever
the cause was, love’s young dream was shattered,
and there was nothing left but the painful
memory of an error, to be atoned for in later years
as best he could.</p>

<p>His political hopes and ideals were darkened by
the actual horrors which filled Paris during the fall
of 1792. His impulse to become a revolutionist
was shaken, if not altogether broken. Returning to
England at the end of the same year, he tried to
sustain his sinking spirits by setting in order the
reasons and grounds of his new-born enthusiasm,
already waning. His letter to Bishop Watson, written
in 1793, is the fullest statement of republican
sympathies that he ever made. In it he even seems
to justify the execution of Louis XVI, and makes
light of “the idle cry of modish lamentation which
has resounded from the court to the cottage” over
the royal martyr’s fate. He defends the right of
the people to overthrow all who oppress them, to
choose their own rulers, to direct their own destiny
by universal suffrage, and to sweep all obstacles
out of their way. The reasoning is so absolute, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
relentless, the scorn for all who oppose it is so lofty,
that already we begin to suspect a wavering conviction
intrenching itself for safety.</p>

<p>The course of events in France was ill fitted to
nourish the joy of a pure-minded enthusiast. The
tumultuous terrors of the Revolution trod its ideals
in the dust. Its light was obscured in its own sulphurous
smoke. Robespierre ran his bloody course
to the end; and when his head fell under the guillotine,
Wordsworth could not but exult. War was
declared between France and England, and his
heart was divided; but the deeper and stronger
ties were those that bound him to his own country.
He was English in his very flesh and bones. The
framework of his mind was of Cumberland. So
he stood rooted in his native allegiance, while the
leaves and blossoms of joy fell from him, like a tree
stripped bare by the first great gale of autumn.</p>

<p>The years from 1793 to 1795 were the period of
his deepest poverty, spiritual and material. His
youthful poems, published in 1793, met with no
more success than they deserved. His plans for
entering into active life were feeble and futile. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
mind was darkened and confused, his faith shaken
to the foundation, and his feelings clouded with
despair. In this crisis of disaster two gifts of fortune
came to him. His sister Dorothy took her
place at his side, to lead him back by her wise, tender,
cheerful love from the far country of despair.
His friend Raisley Calvert bequeathed to him a
legacy of nine hundred pounds; a small inheritance,
but enough to protect him from the wolf of poverty,
while he devoted his life to the muse. From the
autumn of 1795, when he and his sister set up housekeeping
together in a farmhouse at Racedown, until
his death in 1850 in the cottage at Rydal Mount,
where he had lived for thirty-seven years with his
wife and children, there was never any doubt about
the disposition of his life. It was wholly dedicated
to poetry.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>But what kind of poetry? What was to be its
motive power? What its animating spirit? Here
the experience of life acting upon his natural character
became the deciding factor.</p>

<p>Wordsworth was born a lover of joy, not sensual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
but spiritual. The first thing that happened to
him, when he went out into the world, was that he
went bankrupt of joy. The enthusiasm of his youth
was dashed, the high hope of his spirit was quenched.
At the touch of reality his dreams dissolved. It
seemed as though he were altogether beaten, a
broken man. But with the gentle courage of his
sister to sustain him, his indomitable spirit rose
again, to renew the adventure of life. He did not
evade the issue, by turning aside to seek for fame
or wealth. His problem from first to last was the
problem of joy,—inward, sincere, imperishable
joy. How to recover it after life’s disappointments,
how to deepen it amid life’s illusions, how to secure
it through life’s trials, how to spread it among life’s
confusions,—this was the problem that he faced.
This was the wealth that he desired to possess, and
to increase, and to diffuse,—the wealth</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Of joy in widest commonalty spread.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>None of the poets has been as clear as Wordsworth
in the avowal that the immediate end of poetry
is pleasure. “We have no sympathy,” said he,
“but what is propagated by pleasure, ... wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
we sympathise with pain, it will be found that the
sympathy is produced and carried on by subtle
combinations with pleasure. We have no knowledge,
that is no general principles drawn from the
contemplation of particular facts, but what has
been built up by pleasure, and exists in us by pleasure
alone.” And again: “The end of Poetry is to
produce excitement, in co-existence with an over-balance
of pleasure.”</p>

<p class="caption-copy"><i>After an engraving by J. Bromley.</i></p>
</div>

<p>But it may be clearly read in his poetry that
what he means by “pleasure” is really an inward,
spiritual joy. It is such a joy, in its various
forms, that charms him most as he sees it in the
world. His gallery of human portraits contains
many figures, but every one of them is presented
in the light of joy,—the rising light of dawn, or the
waning light of sunset. <cite>Lucy Gray</cite> and the little
maid in <cite>We are Seven</cite> are childish shapes of joy.
The <cite>Highland Girl</cite> is an embodiment of virginal
gladness, and the poet cries</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace</div>
<div class="verse">Hath led me to this lovely place.</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Joy have I had</em>; and going hence</div>
<div class="verse">I bear away my recompence.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Wordsworth regards joy as an actual potency of
vision:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“With an eye made quiet by the power</div>
<div class="verse">Of harmony, and <em>the deep power of joy</em>,</div>
<div class="verse">We see into the heart of things.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Joy is indeed the master-word of his poetry. The
dancing daffodils enrich his heart with joy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“They flash upon that inward eye</div>
<div class="verse">Which is the bliss of solitude;</div>
<div class="verse">And then my heart with pleasure fills,</div>
<div class="verse">And dances with the daffodils.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The kitten playing with the fallen leaves charms
him with pure merriment. The skylark’s song
lifts him up into the clouds.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There is madness about thee, and <em>joy divine</em></div>
<div class="verse">In that song of thine.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He turns from the nightingale, that creature of a
“fiery heart,” to the Stock-dove:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“He sang of love, with quiet blending,</div>
<div class="verse">Slow to begin and never ending;</div>
<div class="verse">Of serious faith, <em>and inward glee</em>;</div>
<div class="verse">That was the song—the song for me.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He thinks of love which grows to use</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<em>Joy as her holiest language.</em>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">He speaks of life’s disenchantments and wearinesses
as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<em>All that is at enmity with joy.</em>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When autumn closes around him, and the season
makes him conscious that his leaf is sere and yellow
on the bough, he exclaims</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<em>Yet will I temperately rejoice</em>;</div>
<div class="verse">Wide is the range and free the choice</div>

<div class="verse">Which haply kindred souls may prize</div>
<div class="verse">Not less than vernal ecstacies,</div>
<div class="verse">And passion’s feverish dreams.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><em>Temperate rejoicing</em>,—that is the clearest note of
Wordsworth’s poetry. Not an unrestrained gladness,
for he can never escape from that deep, strange
experience of his youth. Often, in thought, he</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Must hear Humanity in fields and groves</div>
<div class="verse">Pipe solitary anguish; or must hang</div>

<div class="verse">Of sorrow, barricadoed evermore</div>
<div class="verse">Within the walls of cities.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But even while he hears these sounds he will not be
“downcast or forlorn.” He will find a deeper music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to conquer these clashing discords. He will learn,
and teach, a hidden joy, strong to survive amid
the sorrows of a world like this. He will not look
for it in some far-off unrealized Utopia,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“But in the very world which is the world</div>
<div class="verse">Of all of us,—<em>the place where in the end</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>We find our happiness, or not at all</em>!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To this quest of joy, to this proclamation of joy, he
dedicates his life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent15">“By words</div>
<div class="verse">Which speak of nothing more than what we are</div>
<div class="verse">Would I arouse the sensual from their sleep</div>
<div class="verse">Of Death, and win the vacant and the vain</div>
<div class="verse"><em>To noble raptures</em>.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And herein he becomes a prophet to his age,—a
prophet of the secret of joy, simple, universal, enduring,—the
open secret.</p>

<p>The burden of Wordsworth’s prophecy of joy,
as found in his poetry, is threefold. First, he declares
with exultation that he has seen in Nature
the evidence of a living spirit in vital correspondence
with the spirit of man. Second, he expresses the
deepest, tenderest feeling of the inestimable value
of the humblest human life,—a feeling which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
through all its steadiness is yet strangely illumined
by sudden gushes of penetration and pathos. Third,
he proclaims a lofty ideal of the liberty and greatness
of man, consisting in obedience to law and
fidelity to duty.</p>

<p>I am careful in choosing words to describe the
manner of this threefold prophesying, because I am
anxious to distinguish it from didacticism. Not
that Wordsworth is never didactic; for he is very
often entirely and dreadfully so. But at such
times he is not at his best; and it is in these long
uninspired intervals that we must bear, as Walter
Pater has said, “With patience the presence of an
alien element in Wordsworth’s work, which never
coalesced with what is really delightful in it, nor
underwent his peculiar power.” Wordsworth’s
genius as a poet did not always illuminate his industry
as a writer. In the intervals he prosed terribly.
There is a good deal of what Lowell calls
“Dr. Wattsiness,” in some of his poems.</p>

<p>But the character of his best poems was strangely
inspirational. They came to him like gifts, and he
read them aloud as if wondering at their beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Through the protracted description of an excursion,
or the careful explanation of a state of mind, he
slowly plods on foot; but when he comes to the
mount of vision, he mounts up with wings as an
eagle. In the analysis of a character, in the narration
of a simple story, he often drones, and sometimes
stammers; but when the flash of insight arrives,
he sings. This is the difference between the
pedagogue and the prophet: the pedagogue repeats
a lesson learned by rote, the prophet chants a truth
revealed by vision.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Let me speak first of Wordsworth as a poet of
Nature. The peculiar and precious quality of his
best work is that it is done with his eye on the object
and his imagination beyond it.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more accurate, more true to
the facts than Wordsworth’s observation of the
external world. There was an underlying steadiness,
a fundamental placidity, a kind of patient,
heroic obstinacy in his character, which blended
with his delicate, almost tremulous sensibility, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
make him rarely fitted for this work. He could
look and listen long. When the magical moment
of disclosure arrived, he was there and ready.</p>

<p>Some of his senses were not particularly acute.
Odours seem not to have affected him. There are
few phrases descriptive of the fragrance of nature
in his poetry, and so far as I can remember none
of them are vivid. He could never have written
Tennyson’s line about</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The smell of violets hidden in the green.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nor was he especially sensitive to colour. Most
of his descriptions in this region are vague and
luminous, rather than precise and brilliant. Colour-words
are comparatively rare in his poems. Yellow,
I think, was his favourite, if we may judge by the
flowers that he mentioned most frequently. Yet
more than any colour he loved clearness, transparency,
the diaphanous current of a pure stream,
the light of sunset</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent13">“that imbues</div>
<div class="verse">Whate’er it strikes with gem-like hues.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But in two things his power of observation was
unsurpassed, I think we may almost say, unrivalled:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in sound, and in movement. For these he had what
he describes in his sailor-brother,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent13">“a watchful heart</div>
<div class="verse">Still couchant, an inevitable ear,</div>
<div class="verse">And an eye practiced like a blind man’s touch.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In one of his juvenile poems, a sonnet describing
the stillness of the world at twilight, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Calm is all nature as a resting wheel;</div>
<div class="verse">The kine are couched upon the dewy grass,</div>
<div class="verse">The horse alone seen dimly as I pass,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Is cropping audibly his evening meal</em>.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At nightfall, while he is listening to the hooting of
the owls and mocking them, there comes an interval
of silence, and then</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“a gentle shock of mild surprise</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Has carried far into his heart the voice</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>Of mountain torrents</em>.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At midnight, on the summit of Snowdon, from a
rift in the cloud-ocean at his feet, he hears</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent3">“the roar of waters, torrents, streams</div>
<div class="verse">Innumerable, roaring with one voice.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Under the shadows of the great yew-trees of Borrowdalek
he loves</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">“To lie and listen to the mountain flood</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wordsworth, more than any other English poet,
interprets and glorifies the mystery of sound. He
is the poet who sits oftenest by the Ear-Gate listening
to the whispers and murmurs of the invisible
guests who throng that portal into “the city of
Man-Soul.” Indeed the whole spiritual meaning
of nature seems to come to him in the form of sound.</p>

<p>No less wonderful is his sense of the delicate motions

<p>Now in such an observation of Nature as this,
so keen, so patient, so loving, so delicate, there is
an immediate comfort for the troubled mind, a
direct refuge and repose for the heart. To see and
hear such things is peace and joy. It is a consolation
and an education. Wordsworth himself has
said this very distinctly.</p>

<p class="noindent">But the most perfect expression of his faith in the

</div>

<p>The personification of Nature in this poem is at
the farthest removed from the traditional poetic
fiction which peopled the world with Dryads and
Nymphs and Oreads. Nor has it any touch of the
“pathetic fallacy” which imposes the thoughts and
feelings of man upon natural objects. It presents
unconsciously, very simply, and yet prophetically,
Wordsworth’s vision of Nature,—a vision whose
distinctive marks are vitality and unity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>It is his faith that “every flower enjoys the air
it breathes.” It is also his faith that underlying
and animating all this joy there is the life of one
mighty Spirit. This faith rises to its most magnificent
expression in the famous <cite>Lines composed a
few miles above Tintern Abbey</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent10">“And I have felt</div>
<div class="verse">A presence that disturbs me with the joy</div>
<div class="verse">Of elevated thought; a sense sublime</div>
<div class="verse">Of something far more deeply interfused,</div>
<div class="verse">Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,</div>
<div class="verse">And the round ocean and the living air,</div>
<div class="verse">And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:</div>
<div class="verse">A motion and a spirit, that impels</div>
<div class="verse">All thinking things, all objects of all thought,</div>
<div class="verse">And rolls through all things.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The union of this animating Spirit of Nature, with
the beholding, contemplating, rejoicing spirit of
man is like a pure and noble marriage, in which man
attains peace and the spousal consummation of his
being. This is the first remedy which Wordsworth
finds for the malady of despair, the first and simplest
burden of his prophecy of joy. And he utters
it with confidence,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Knowing that Nature never did betray</div>
<div class="verse">The heart that loved her; ’tis her privilege,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Through all the years of this our life, to lead</div>

<div class="verse">The mind that is within us, so impress</div>
<div class="verse">With quietness and beauty, and so feed</div>
<div class="verse">With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,</div>
<div class="verse">Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all</div>
<div class="verse">The dreary intercourse of daily life,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall e’er prevail against us, or disturb</div>
<div class="verse">Our cheerful faith that all which we behold</div>
<div class="verse">Is full of blessings.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Side by side with this revelation of Nature, and
interwoven with it so closely as to be inseparable,
Wordsworth was receiving a revelation of humanity,
no less marvellous, no less significant for his recovery
of joy. Indeed he himself seems to have
thought it the more important of the two, for he
speaks of the mind of man as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“My haunt and the main region of my song”;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And again he says that he will set out, like an adventurer,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And through the human heart explore the way;</div>
<div class="verse">And look and listen—gathering whence I may,</div>
<div class="verse">Triumph, and thoughts no bondage can restrain.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>The discovery of humble life, of peasant character,
of lowly, trivial scenes and incidents, as a
field for poetry, was not original with Wordsworth.
But he was the first English poet to explore this field
thoroughly, sympathetically, with steady and deepening
joy. Burns had been there before him; but
the song of Burns though clear and passionate, was
fitful. Cowper had been there before him; but Cowper
was like a visitor from the polite world, never an
inhabitant, never quite able to pierce gently, powerfully
down to the realities of lowly life and abide
in them. Crabbe had been there before him; but
Crabbe was something of a pessimist; he felt the
rough shell of the nut, but did not taste the sweet
kernel.</p>

<p>Wordsworth, if I may draw a comparison from
another art, was the Millet of English poetry. In
his verse we find the same quality of perfect comprehension,
of tender pathos, of absolute truth interfused
with delicate beauty that makes Millet’s
<cite>Angelus</cite>, and <cite>The Gleaners</cite> and <cite>The Sower</cite> and <cite>The
Sheepfold</cite>, immortal visions of the lowly life. Place
beside these pictures, if you will, Wordsworth’s
<cite>Solitary Reaper</cite>, <cite>The Old Cumberland Beggar</cite>, <cite>Margaret</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
waiting in her ruined cottage for the husband
who would never return, <cite>Michael</cite>, the old shepherd
who stood, many and many a day, beside the unfinished
sheepfold which he had begun to build
with his lost boy,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“And never lifted up a single stone,”—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">place these beside Millet’s pictures, and the poems
will bear the comparison.</p>

<p>Coleridge called Wordsworth “a miner of the
human heart.” But there is a striking peculiarity
in his mining: he searched the most familiar places,
by the most simple methods, to bring out the rarest
and least suspected treasures. His discovery was
that there is an element of poetry, like some metal
of great value, diffused through the common clay
of every-day life.</p>

<p>It is true that he did not always succeed in separating
the precious metal from the surrounding
dross. There were certain limitations in his mind
which prevented him from distinguishing that which
was familiar and precious, from that which was
merely familiar.</p>

<p>One of these limitations was his lack of a sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of humour. At a dinner-party he announced that
he was never witty but once in his life. When asked
to narrate the instance, after some hesitation he
said: “Well, I will tell you. I was standing some
time ago at the entrance of my cottage at Rydal
Mount. A man accosted me with the question,
‘Pray, sir, have you seen my wife pass by?’ Whereupon
I said, ‘Why, my good friend, I didn’t know
till this moment that you had a wife!’” The humour
of this story is unintentional and lies otherwhere
than Wordsworth thought. The fact that
he was capable of telling it as a merry jest accounts
for the presence of many queer things in his poetry.
For example; the lines in <cite>Simon Lee</cite>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Few months of life has he in store</div>
<div class="verse indent1">As he to you will tell,</div>
<div class="verse">For still the more he works, the more</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Do his weak ankles swell:”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the stanza in <cite>Peter Bell</cite>, which Shelley was accused
of having maliciously invented, but which was actually
printed in the first edition of the poem,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Is it a party in a parlour</div>
<div class="verse">Cramming just as they on earth were crammed,</div>
<div class="verse">Some sipping punch—some sipping tea</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But, as you by their faces see,</div>
<div class="verse">All silent and all—damned?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the couplet in the original version of <cite>The Blind
Highland Boy</cite> which describes him as embarking
on his voyage in</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A household tub, like one of those</div>
<div class="verse">Which women use to wash their clothes.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is quite certain, I think, that Wordsworth’s insensibility
to the humourous side of things made
him incapable of perceiving one considerable source
of comfort and solace in lowly life. Plain and poor
people get a great deal of consolation, in their hard
journey, out of the rude but keen fun that they
take by the way. The sense of humour is a means
of grace.</p>

<p>I doubt whether Wordsworth’s peasant-poetry
has ever been widely popular among peasants themselves.
There was an old farmer in the Lake Country
who had often seen the poet and talked with
him, and who remembered him well. Canon Rawnsley
has made an interesting record of some of the
old man’s reminiscences. When he was asked
whether he had ever read any of Wordsworth’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
poetry, or seen any of his books about in the farmhouses,
he answered:</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, time or two. But ya’re weel aware
there’s potry and potry. There’s potry wi’ a li’le
bit pleasant in it, and potry sic as a man can laugh
at or the childer understand, and some as takes a
deal of mastery to make out what’s said, and a deal
of Wordsworth’s was this sort, ye kna. You could
tell fra the man’s faace his potry would niver have
no laugh in it.”</p>

<p>But when we have admitted these limitations, it
remains true that no other English poet has penetrated
so deeply into the springs of poetry which
rise by every cottage door, or sung so nobly of the
treasures which are hidden in the humblest human
heart, as Wordsworth has. This is his merit, his
incomparable merit, that he has done so much, amid
the hard conditions, the broken dreams, and the
cruel necessities of life, to remind us how rich we
are in being simply human.</p>

<p>Like Clifford, in the <cite>Song at the Feast of Brougham
Castle</cite>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Love had he found in huts where poor men lie,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">and thenceforth his chosen task was to explore the
beauty and to show the power of that common love.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“There is a comfort in the strength of love;</div>
<div class="verse">’Twill make a thing endurable, which else</div>
<div class="verse">Would overset the brain or break the heart.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He found the best portion of a good man’s life in</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“His little, nameless, unremembered acts</div>
<div class="verse">Of kindness and of love.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In <cite>The Old Cumberland Beggar</cite> he declared</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent10">“’Tis Nature’s law</div>
<div class="verse">That none, the meanest of created things,</div>
<div class="verse">Of forms created the most vile and brute,</div>
<div class="verse">The dullest or most noxious, should exist</div>
<div class="verse">Divorced from good—a spirit and pulse of good,</div>
<div class="verse">A life and soul, to every mode of being</div>
<div class="verse">Inseparably linked.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And then he went on to trace, not always with full
poetic inspiration, but still with many touches of
beautiful insight, the good that the old beggar did
and received in the world, by wakening among the
peasants to whose doors he came from year to year,
the memory of past deeds of charity, by giving them
a sense of kinship with the world of want and sorrow,
and by bestowing on them in their poverty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the opportunity of showing mercy to one whose
needs were even greater than their own; for,—the
poet adds—with one of those penetrating flashes
which are the surest mark of his genius,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Man is dear to man; the poorest poor</div>
<div class="verse">Long for some moments in a weary life</div>
<div class="verse">When they can know and feel that they have been,</div>
<div class="verse">Themselves, the fathers and the dealers out</div>
<div class="verse">Of some small blessings; have been kind to such</div>
<div class="verse">As needed kindness, for this single cause</div>
<div class="verse">That we have all of us one human heart.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Nor did Wordsworth forget, in his estimate of the
value of the simplest life, those pleasures which are
shared by all men.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Nuns fret not at their convent’s narrow room;</div>
<div class="verse">And hermits are contented with their cells;</div>
<div class="verse">And students with their pensive citadels;</div>
<div class="verse">Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,</div>
<div class="verse">Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom</div>
<div class="verse">High as the highest Peak of Furniss-fells,</div>
<div class="verse">Will murmur by the hour in fox-glove bells;</div>
<div class="verse">In truth the prison, unto which we doom</div>
<div class="verse">Ourselves, no prison is.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He sees a Miller dancing with two girls on the platform
of a boat moored in the river Thames, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
breaks out into a song on the “stray pleasures”
that are spread through the earth to be claimed by
whoever shall find them. A little crowd of poor
people gather around a wandering musician in a
city street, and the poet cries,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Now, coaches and chariots! roar on like a stream;</div>
<div class="verse">Here are twenty souls happy as souls in a dream;</div>
<div class="verse">They are deaf to your murmurs—they care not for you,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor what ye are flying, nor what ye pursue!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He describes Coleridge and himself as lying together
on the greensward in the orchard by the cottage at
Grasmere, and says</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“If but a bird, to keep them company,</div>
<div class="verse">Or butterfly sate down, they were, I ween,</div>
<div class="verse">As pleased as if the same had been a maiden Queen.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was of such simple and unchartered blessings
that he loved to sing. He did not think that the
vain or the worldly would care to listen to his voice.
Indeed he said in a memorable passage of gentle scorn
that he did not expect his poetry to be fashionable.
“It is an awful truth,” wrote he to Lady Beaumont,
“that there neither is nor can be any genuine enjoyment
of poetry among nineteen out of twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of those persons who either live or wish to live in
the broad light of the world,—among those who
either are, or are striving to make themselves, people
of consideration in society. This is a truth, and an
awful one, because to be incapable of a feeling of
poetry, in my sense of the word, is to be without
love of human nature and reverence for God.” He
did not expect that his poetry would be popular in
that world where men and women devote themselves
to the business of pleasure, and where they care
only for the things that minister to vanity or selfishness,—and
it never was.</p>

<p>But there was another world where he expected
to be welcome and of service. He wished his poetry
to cheer the solitary, to uplift the downcast, to bid
the despairing hope again, to teach the impoverished
how much treasure was left to them. In short, he
intended by the quiet ministry of his art to be one
of those</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Poets who keep the world in heart,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—and so he was.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the value of such
a service. Measured by any true and vital standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Wordsworth’s contribution to the welfare of mankind
was greater, more enduring than that of the
amazing Corsican, Bonaparte, who was born but a
few months before him and blazed his way to glory.
Wordsworth’s service was to life at its fountain-head.
His remedy for the despair and paralysis of
the soul was not the prescription of a definite philosophy
as an antidote. It was a hygienic method,
a simple, healthful, loving life in fellowship with
man and nature, by which the native tranquillity
and vigour of the soul would be restored. The tendency
of his poetry is to enhance our interest in
humanity, to promote the cultivation of the small
but useful virtues, to brighten our joy in common
things, and to deepen our trust in a wise, kind, over-ruling
God. Wordsworth gives us not so much a
new scheme of life as a new sense of its interior and
inalienable wealth. His calm, noble, lofty poetry
is needed to-day to counteract the belittling and
distracting influence of great cities; to save us from
that most modern form of insanity, publicomania,
which sacrifices all the sanctities of life to the craze
for advertising; and to make a little quiet space in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the heart, where those who are still capable of
thought, in this age of clattering machinery, shall
be able to hear themselves think.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>But there is one still deeper element in Wordsworth’s
poetry. He tells us very clearly that the
true liberty and grandeur of <em>mankind</em> are to be found
along the line of obedience to law and fidelity to
duty. This is the truth which was revealed to him,
slowly and serenely, as a consolation for the loss of
his brief revolutionary dream. He learned to rejoice
in it more and more deeply, and to proclaim
it more and more clearly, as his manhood settled
into firmness and strength.</p>

<p>Fixing his attention at first upon the humblest
examples of the power of the human heart to resist
unfriendly circumstances, as in <cite>Resolution and
Independence</cite>, and to endure sufferings and trials,
as in <cite>Margaret</cite> and <cite>Michael</cite>, he grew into a new
conception of the right nobility. He saw that it
was not necessary to make a great overturning of
society before the individual man could begin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
fulfil his destiny. “What then remains?” he
cries—</p>

<div class="verse">Without access of unexpected strength.</div>
<div class="verse">But, above all, the victory is sure</div>
<div class="verse">For him, who seeking faith by virtue, strives</div>
<div class="verse">To yield entire submission to the law</div>
<div class="verse">Of conscience—conscience reverenced and obeyed,</div>
<div class="verse">As God’s most intimate presence in the soul,</div>
<div class="verse">And his most perfect image in the world.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If we would hear this message breathed in tones of
lyric sweetness, as to the notes of a silver harp, we
may turn to Wordsworth’s poems on the Skylark,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Type of the wise who soar, but never roam;</div>
<div class="verse">True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If we would hear it proclaimed with grandeur, as
by a solemn organ; or with martial ardour, as by
a ringing trumpet, we may read the <cite>Ode to Duty</cite> or
<cite>The Character of the Happy Warrior</cite>, two of the
noblest and most weighty poems that Wordsworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
ever wrote. There is a certain distinction and elevation
about his moral feelings which makes them
in themselves poetic. In his poetry beauty is goodness
and goodness is beauty.</p>

<p>But I think it is in the Sonnets that this element
of Wordsworth’s poetry finds the broadest and most
perfect expression. For here he sweeps upward
from the thought of the freedom and greatness of
the individual man to the vision of nations and
races emancipated and ennobled by loyalty to the
right. How pregnant and powerful are his phrases!
“Plain living and high thinking.” “The homely
beauty of the good old cause.” “A few strong instincts
and a few plain rules.” “Man’s unconquerable
mind.” “By the soul only, the Nations shall
be great and free.” The whole series of <cite>Sonnets
addressed to Liberty</cite>, published in 1807, is full of
poetic and prophetic fire. But none among them
burns with a clearer light, none is more characteristic
of him at his best, than that which is entitled
<cite>London, 1802</cite>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Milton! thou should’st be living at this hour;</div>
<div class="verse">England hath need of thee; she is a fen</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen,</div>

<div class="verse">Thou had’st a voice whose sound was like the sea:</div>
<div class="verse">Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,</div>
<div class="verse">So didst thou travel on life’s common way</div>
<div class="verse">In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart</div>
<div class="verse">The lowliest duties on herself did lay.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This sonnet embraces within its “scanty plot of
ground” the roots of Wordsworth’s strength. Here
is his view of nature in the kinship between the
lonely star and the solitary soul. Here is his recognition
of life’s common way as the path of honour,
and of the lowliest duties as the highest. Here is
his message that manners and virtue must go before
freedom and power. And here is the deep spring
and motive of all his work, in the thought that <em>joy</em>,
<em>inward happiness</em>, is the dower that has been lost
and must be regained.</p>

<p>Here then I conclude this chapter on Wordsworth.
There are other things that might well be said about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
him, indeed that would need to be said if this were
intended for a complete estimate of his influence.
I should wish to speak of the deep effect which
his poetry has had upon the style of other poets,
breaking the bondage of “poetic diction” and leading
the way to a simpler and more natural utterance.
I should need to touch upon his alleged
betrayal of his early revolutionary principles in
politics, and to show, (if a paradox may be pardoned),
that he never had them and that he always kept
them. He never forsook liberty; he only changed
his conception of it. He saw that the reconstruction
of society must be preceded by reconstruction
of the individual. Browning’s stirring lyric, <cite>The
Lost Leader</cite>,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Just for a handful of silver he left us,</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Just for a ribbon to stick in his coat,”—</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">may have been written with Wordsworth in mind,
but it was a singularly infelicitous suggestion of a
remarkably good poem.</p>

<p>All of these additions would be necessary if this
estimate were intended to be complete. But it is
not, and so let it stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>If we were to choose a motto for Wordsworth’s
poetry it might be this: “Rejoice, and again I say
unto you, rejoice.” And if we looked farther for a
watchword, we might take it from that other great
poet, Isaiah, standing between the fierce radicals
and sullen conservatives of Israel, and saying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a striking contrast between the poetry
of Browning and the poetry of Wordsworth; and
this comes naturally from the difference between
the two men in genius, temperament and life. I
want to trace carefully and perhaps more clearly
some of the lines of that difference. I do not propose
to ask which of them ranks higher as poet.
That seems to me a futile question. The contrast
in kind interests me more than the comparison of
degree. And this contrast, I think, can best be
felt and understood through a closer knowledge of
the central theme of each of the two poets.</p>

<p>Wordsworth is a poet of recovered joy. He brings
consolation and refreshment to the heart,—consolation
which is passive strength, refreshment
which is peaceful energy. His poetry is addressed
not to crowds, but to men standing alone, and feeling
their loneliness most deeply when the crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
presses most tumultuously about them. He speaks
to us one by one, distracted by the very excess of
life, separated from humanity by the multitude of
men, dazzled by the shifting variety of hues into
which the eternal light is broken by the prism of
the world,—one by one he accosts us, and leads us
gently back, if we will follow him, into a more tranquil
region and a serener air. There we find the
repose of “a heart at leisure from itself.” There
we feel the unity of man and nature, and of both
in God. There we catch sight of those eternal stars
of truth whose shining, though sometimes hidden,
is never dimmed by the cloud-confusions of morality.
Such is the mission of Wordsworth to the
age. Matthew Arnold has described it with profound
beauty.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“He found us when the age had bound</div>
<div class="verse">Our souls in its benumbing round,</div>
<div class="verse">He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears.</div>
<div class="verse">He laid us as we lay at birth</div>
<div class="verse">On the cool flowery lap of earth,</div>
<div class="verse">Smiles broke from us and we had ease,</div>
<div class="verse">The hills were round us, and the breeze</div>
<div class="verse">Went o’er the sun-lit fields again:</div>
<div class="verse">Our foreheads felt the wind and rain.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Our youth returned; for there was shed</div>
<div class="verse">On spirits that had long been dead,</div>
<div class="verse">Spirits dried up and closely furled,</div>
<div class="verse">The freshness of the early world.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But precious as such a service is and ever must
be, it does not fill the whole need of man’s heart.
There are times and moods in which it seems pale
and ineffectual. The very contrast between its
serenity, its assurance, its disembodied passion, its
radiant asceticism, and the mixed lights, the broken
music, the fluctuating faith, the confused conflict
of actual life, seems like a discouragement. It calls
us to go into a retreat, that we may find ourselves
and renew our power to live. But there are natures
which do not easily adapt themselves to a retreat,—natures
which crave stimulus more than consolation,
and look for a solution of life’s problem that can be
worked out while they are in motion. They do not
wish, perhaps they are not able, to withdraw themselves
from active life even for the sake of seeing
it more clearly.</p>

<p>Wordsworth’s world seems to them too bare, too
still, too monotonous. The rugged and unpopulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
mountains, the lonely lakes, the secluded vales, do
not attract them as much as the fertile plain with
its luxuriant vegetation, the whirling city, the
crowded highways of trade and pleasure. Simplicity
is strange to them; complexity is their native
element. They want music, but they want it
to go with them in the march, the parade, the festal
procession. The poet for them must be in the world,
though he need not be altogether of it. He must
speak of the rich and varied life of man as one who
knows its artificial as well as its natural elements,—palaces
as well as cottages, courts as well as sheep-folds.
Art and politics and literature and science
and churchmanship and society,—all must be familiar
to him, material to his art, significant to his
interpretation. His message must be modern and
militant. He must not disregard doubt and rebellion
and discord, but take them into his poetry and transform
them. He must front</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The cloud of mortal destiny,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and make the most of the light that breaks through
it. Such a poet is Robert Browning; and his poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
is the direct answer to at least one side of the modern
<i lang="de">Zeitgeist</i>, restless, curious, self-conscious, energetic,
the active, questioning spirit.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Browning’s poetic work-time covered a period of
about fifty-six years, (1833-1889,) and during this
time he published over thirty volumes of verse,
containing more than two hundred and thirty poems,
the longest, <cite>The Ring and the Book</cite>, extending to
nearly twenty-one thousand lines. It was an immense
output, greater I think, in mass, than that of
almost any other English poet except Shakespeare.
The mere fact of such productiveness is worth noting,
because it is a proof of the activity of the poet’s
mind, and also because it may throw some light
upon certain peculiarities in the quality of his work.</p>

<p>Browning not only wrote much himself, he was
also the cause of much writing in others. Commentaries,
guide-books, handbooks, and expositions
have grown up around his poetry so fast that the
vines almost hide the trellis. The Browning Literature
now demands not merely a shelf, but a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
case to itself in the library. It has come to such a
pass that one must choose between reading the
books that Browning wrote and the books that
other people have written about Browning. Life
is too short for both.</p>

<p>A reason, if not a justification, for this growth
of a locksmith literature about his work is undoubtedly
to be found in what Mr. Augustine Birrell
calls “The Alleged Obscurity of Mr. Browning’s
Poetry.” The adjective in this happy title indicates
one of the points in the voluminous discussion.
Does the difficulty in understanding Browning lie
in him, or in his readers? Is it an accidental defect
of his style, or a valuable element of his art,
or an inherent profundity of his subject that makes
him hard to read? Or does the trouble reside altogether
in the imagination of certain readers, or perhaps
in their lack of it? This question was debated
so seriously as to become at times almost personal
and threaten the unity of households if not the peace
of nations. Browning himself was accustomed to
tell the story of a young man who could not read
his poetry, falling deeply in love with a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
woman who would hardly read anything else. She
made it a condition of her favour that her lover
should learn to love her poet, and therefore set the
marriage day at a point beyond the time when the
bridegroom could present himself before her with
convincing evidence that he had perused the works
of Browning down to the last line. Such was the
strength of love that the condition was triumphantly
fulfilled. The poet used to tell with humourous
satisfaction that he assisted in person at the wedding
of these two lovers whose happiness he had
unconsciously delayed and accomplished.</p>

<p>But an incident like this does not contribute much
to the settlement of the controversy which it illustrates.
Love is a notorious miracle-worker. The
question of Browning’s obscurity is still debatable;
and whatever may be said on one side or the other,
one fact must be recognized: it is not yet quite clear
whether his poetry is clear or not.</p>

<p>To this fact I would trace the rise and flourishing
of Browning Societies in considerable abundance,
during the late Victorian Era, especially near Boston.
The enterprise of reading and understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Browning presented itself as an affair too large and
difficult for the intellectual capital of any private
person. Corporations were formed, stock companies
of intelligence were promoted, for the purpose of
working the field of his poetry. The task which
daunted the solitary individual was courageously
undertaken by phalanxes and cheerfully pursued in
fellowship. Thus the obscurity, alleged or actual, of
the poet’s writing, having been at first a hindrance,
afterward became an advertisement to his fame.
The charm of the enigma, the fascination of solving
riddles, the pleasure of understanding something
which other people at least professed to be unable to
understand, entered distinctly into the growth of his
popularity. A Browning cult, a Browning propaganda,
came into being and toiled tremendously.</p>

<p>One result of the work of these clubs and societies
is already evident: they have done much to remove
the cause which called them into being. It is generally
recognized that a considerable part of Browning’s
poetry is not really so difficult after all. It
can be read and enjoyed by any one whose mind
is in working order. Those innocent and stupid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Victorians were wrong about it. We alert and sagacious
George-the-Fifthians need some tougher
poetry to try our mettle. So I suppose the Browning
Societies, having fulfilled their function, will
gradually fade away,—or perhaps transfer their
attention to some of those later writers who have
put obscurity on a scientific basis and raised impenetrability
to a fine art. Meantime I question
whether all the claims which were made on behalf
of Browning in the period of propaganda will be
allowed at their face value. For example, that <cite>The
Ring and the Book</cite> is “the greatest work of creative
imagination that has appeared since the time of
Shakespeare,”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and that <cite>A Grammarian’s Funeral</cite>
is “the most powerful ode in English, the mightiest
tribute ever paid to a man,”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and that Browning’s
“style as it stands is God-made, not Browning-made,”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
appear even now like drafts on glory which
must be discounted before they are paid. Nor does
it seem probable that the general proposition which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
was sometimes advanced by extreme Browningites,
(and others,) to the effect that all great poetry <em>ought</em>
to be hard to read, and that a poem which is easy
cannot be great, will stand the test of time. Milton’s
<cite>Comus</cite>, Gray’s <cite>Elegy</cite>, Wordsworth’s <cite>Ode on
the Intimations of Immortality</cite>, Shelley’s <cite>Skylark</cite>,
Keats’ <cite>Grecian Urn</cite>, and Tennyson’s <cite>Guinevere</cite> cannot
be reduced to the rank of minor verse by such
a formula.</p>

<p>And yet it must be said that the very extravagance
of the claims which were made for Browning,
the audacity of enthusiasm which he inspired in his
expositors, is a proof of the reality and the potency
of his influence. Men are not kindled where there
is no fire. Men do not keep on guessing riddles
unless the answers have some interest and value.
A stock company cannot create a prophet out of
straw. Browning must have had something important
to say to the age, and he must have succeeded
in saying it in a way which was suitable,
in spite of its defects, to convey his message, else
we may be sure his age never would have listened
to him, even by select companies, nor discussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
him, even in a partisan temper, nor felt his influence,
even at second-hand.</p>

<p>What was it, then, that he had to say, and how
did he say it? What was the theme of his poetry,
what the method by which he found it, what the
manner in which he treated it, and what the central
element of his disposition by which the development
of his genius was impelled and guided? These
are the questions,—questions of fact rather than of
theory,—that particularly interest me in regard to
Browning. And I hope it may be possible to consider
them from a somewhat fresh point of view,
and without entering into disturbing and unprofitable
comparisons of rank with Shakespeare and the
other poets.</p>

<p>But there is no reason why the answers to these
questions should be concealed until the end of the
chapter. It may be better to state them now, in
order that we may be able to test them as we go on,
and judge whether they are justified and how far
they need to be qualified. There is a particular
reason for taking this course, in the fact that
Browning changed very little in the process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
growth. There were alterations in his style, but
there was no real alteration in the man, nor in his
poetry. His first theme was his last theme.
His early manner of treatment was his latest
manner of treatment. What he said at the beginning
he said again at the end. With the greatest
possible variety of titles he had but one main
topic; with the widest imaginable range of subjects,
he used chiefly one method and reached but
one conclusion; with a nature of almost unlimited
breadth he was always under control of one central
impulse and loyal to one central quality.
Let me try, then, to condense the general impression
into a paragraph and take up the particulars
afterwards, point by point.</p>

<p>The clew to Browning’s mind, it seems to me, is
vivid and inexhaustible curiosity, dominated by a
strangely steady optimism. His topic is not the
soul, in the abstract, but souls in the concrete.
His chosen method is that of spiritual drama, and
for the most part, monodrama. His manner is the
intense, subtle, passionate style of psychological
realism. His message, uttered through the lips of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a hundred imaginary characters, but always with
his own accent,—his message is “the Glory of the
Imperfect.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The best criticisms of the poets have usually come
from other poets, and often in the form of verse.
Landor wrote of Browning,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“Since Chaucer was alive and hale</div>
<div class="verse">No man hath walked along our roads with step</div>
<div class="verse">So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue</div>
<div class="verse">So varied in discourse.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is a thumb-nail sketch of Browning’s personality,—not
complete, but very lifelike. And when
we add to it Landor’s prose saying that “his is the
surest foot since Chaucer’s, that has waked the
echoes from <em>the difficult places</em> of poetry and of life”
we have a sufficiently plain clew to the unfolding
of Browning’s genius. Unwearying activity, intense
curiosity, variety of expression, and a predominant
interest in the difficult places of poetry and of life,—these
were the striking characteristics of his mind.
In his heart a native optimism, an unconquerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
hopefulness, was the ruling factor. But of that I
shall not speak until later, when we come to consider
his message. For the present we are looking
simply for the mainspring of his immense intellectual
energy.</p>

<p>When I say that the clew to Browning’s mind is
to be found in his curiosity, I do not mean inquisitiveness,
but a very much larger and nobler quality,
for which we have no good word in English,—something
which corresponds with the German <i lang="de">Wissbegier</i>,
as distinguished from <i lang="de">Neugier</i>: an ardent
desire to know things as they are, to penetrate as
many as possible of the secrets of actual life. This,
it seems to me, is the key to Browning’s intellectual
disposition. He puts it into words in his first poem
<cite>Pauline</cite>, where he makes the nameless hero speak
of his life as linked to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“a principle of restlessness</div>
<div class="verse">Which would be all, have, see, know, taste, feel, all—</div>
<div class="verse">This is myself; and I should thus have been</div>
<div class="verse">Though gifted lower than the meanest soul.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><cite>Paracelsus</cite> is only an expansion of this theme in
the biography of a soul. In <cite>Fra Lippo Lippi</cite> the
painter says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“God made it all!</div>
<div class="verse">For what? Do you feel thankful, ay or no,</div>
<div class="verse">For this fair town’s face, yonder river’s line,</div>
<div class="verse">The mountain round it and the sky above,</div>
<div class="verse">Much more the figures of man, woman, child,</div>
<div class="verse">These are the frame to? What’s it all about?</div>
<div class="verse">To be passed over, despised? Or dwelt upon,</div>
<div class="verse">Wondered at? oh, this last of course!—you say.</div>
<div class="verse">But why not do as well as say, paint these</div>
<div class="verse">Just as they are, careless what comes of it?</div>

<div class="verse indent6">... This world’s no blot for us,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor blank; it means intensely and means good:</div>
<div class="verse">To find its meaning is my meat and drink.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">No poet was ever more interested in life than
Browning, and whatever else may be said of his
poetry it must be admitted that it is very interesting.
He touches all sides of human activity and
peers into the secret places of knowledge. He enters
into the life of musicians in <cite>Abt Vogler</cite>, <cite>Master
Hugues of Saxe-Gotha</cite>, <cite>A Toccata of Galuppi’s</cite>, and
<cite>Charles Avison</cite>; into the life of painters in <cite>Andrea
del Sarto</cite>, <cite>Pictor Ignotus</cite>, <cite>Fra Lippo Lippi</cite>, <cite>Old Pictures
in Florence</cite>, <cite>Gerard de Lairesse</cite>, <cite>Pacchiarotto
and How He Worked in Distemper</cite>, and <cite>Francis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Furini</cite>; into the life of scholars in <cite>A Grammarian’s
Funeral</cite> and <cite>Fust and his Friends</cite>; into the
life of politicians in <cite>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau</cite>
and <cite>George Bubb Dodington</cite>; into the life of ecclesiastics
in the <cite>Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister</cite>, <cite>Bishop
Blougram’s Apology</cite>, <cite>The Bishop orders his Tomb
at Saint Praxed’s Church</cite>, and <cite>The Ring and the Book</cite>;
and he makes excursions into all kinds of byways
and crooked corners of life in such poems as
<cite>Mr. Sludge, the Medium</cite>, <cite>Porphyria’s Lover</cite>, <cite>Mesmerism</cite>,
<cite>Johannes Agricola in Meditation</cite>, <cite>Pietro of
Abano</cite>, <cite>Ned Bratts</cite>, <cite>Jochanan Hakkadosh</cite>, and so
forth.</p>

<p>Merely to read a list of such titles is to have evidence
of Browning’s insatiable curiosity. It is evident
also that he has a fondness for out-of-the-way
places. He wants to know, even more than he wants
to enjoy. If Wordsworth is the poet of the common
life, Browning is the poet of the uncommon life.
Extraordinary situations and eccentric characters
attract him. Even when he is looking at some familiar
scene, at some commonplace character, his
effort is to discover something that shall prove that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
it is not familiar, not commonplace,—a singular
detail, a striking feature, a mark of individuality.
This gives him more pleasure than any distant
vision of an abstraction or a general law.</p>

<div class="verse">They would fain see, too,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">My star that dartles the red and the blue!</div>
<div class="verse">Then it stops like a bird; like a flower hangs furled;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">They must solace themselves with the Saturn above it.</div>
<div class="verse">What matter to me if their star is a world?</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Mine has opened its soul to me, therefore I love it.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One consequence of this penetrating, personal
quality of mind is that Browning’s pages teem with
portraits of men and women, which are like sculptures
and paintings of the Renaissance. They are
more individual than they are typical. There is a
peculiarity about each one of them which almost
makes us forget to ask whether they have any general
relation and value. The presentations are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
sharp and vivid that their representative quality is
lost.</p>

<p>If Wordsworth is the Millet of poetry, Browning
is the Holbein or the Denner. He never misses the
mole, the wrinkle, the twist of the eyebrow, which
makes the face stand out alone, the sudden touch of
self-revelation which individualizes the character.
Thus we find in Browning’s poetry few types of
humanity, but plenty of men.</p>

<p>Yet he seldom, if ever, allows us to forget the
background of society. His figures are far more
individual than Wordsworth’s, but far less solitary.
Behind each of them we feel the world out of which
they have come and to which they belong. There
is a sense of crowded life surging through his poetry.
The city, with all that it means, is not often completely
out of view. “Shelley’s characters,” says a
thoughtful essayist, “are creatures of wave and
sky; Wordsworth’s of green English fields; Browning’s
move in the house, the palace, the street.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
In many of them, even when they are soliloquizing,
there is a curious consciousness of opposition, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
conflict. They seem to be defending themselves
against unseen adversaries, justifying their course
against the judgment of absent critics. Thus Bishop
Blougram while he talks over the walnuts and the
wine to Mr. Gigadibs, the sceptical hack-writer,
has a worldful of religious conservatives and radicals
in his eye and makes his half-cynical, wholly militant,
apology for agnostic orthodoxy to them. The
old huntsman, in <cite>The Flight of the Duchess</cite>, is maintaining
the honour of his fugitive mistress against
the dried-up, stiff, conventional society from which
she has eloped with the Gypsies. Andrea del Sarto,
looking at the soulless fatal beauty of his Lucrezia,
and meditating on the splendid failure of his art,
cries out to Rafael and Michelangelo and all his
compeers to understand and judge him.</p>

<p>Even when Browning writes of romantic love,
(one of his two favourite subjects), he almost always
heightens its effect by putting it in relief against the
ignorance, the indifference, the busyness, or the
hostility of the great world. In <cite>Cristina</cite> and <cite>Evelyn
Hope</cite> half the charm of the passion lies in the feeling
that it means everything to the lover though no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
one else in the world may know of its existence.
<cite>Porphyria’s Lover</cite>, in a fit of madness, kills his mistress
to keep her from going back to the world which
would divide them. The sweet searching melody
of <cite>In a Gondola</cite> plays itself athwart a sullen distant
accompaniment of Venetian tyranny and ends with
a swift stroke of vengeance from the secret Three.</p>

<p>Take, for an example of Browning’s way of enhancing
love by contrast, that most exquisite and
subtle lyric called <cite>Love Among the Ruins</cite>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>“Love is best!” That is one of the cardinal
points of Browning’s creed. He repeats it in a hundred
ways: tragically in <cite>A Blot in the ’Scutcheon</cite>;
sentimentally in <cite>A Lover’s Quarrel</cite>, <cite>Two in the Campagna</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
<cite>The Last Ride Together</cite>; heroically in <cite>Colombe’s
Birthday</cite>; in the form of a paradox in <cite>The
Statue and the Bust</cite>; as a personal experience in
<cite>By the Fireside</cite>, <cite>One Word More</cite>, and at the end of
the prelude to <cite>The Ring and the Book</cite>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“For life, with all it yields of joy and woe</div>
<div class="verse">And hope and fear, ...</div>
<div class="verse">Is just our chance o’ the prize of learning love.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But it must be confessed that he does not often
say it as clearly, as quietly, as beautifully as in <cite>Love
Among the Ruins</cite>. For his chosen method is dramatic
and his natural manner is psychological. So
ardently does he follow this method, so entirely
does he give himself up to this manner that his style</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent10">“is subdued</div>
<div class="verse">To what it works in, like the dyer’s hand.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the dedicatory note to <cite>Sordello</cite>, written in 1863,
he says “My stress lay in the incidents in the development
of a <em>soul</em>; little else is worth study.”
He felt intensely</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“How the world is made for each of us!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">How all we perceive and know in it</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Tends to some moment’s product thus,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">When a soul declares itself—to wit,</div>
<div class="verse">By its fruit, the thing it does!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In <cite>One Word More</cite> he describes his own poetry with
keen insight:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Love, you saw me gather men and women,</div>
<div class="verse">Live or dead or fashioned by my fancy,</div>
<div class="verse">Enter each and all and use their service,</div>
<div class="verse">Speak from every mouth,—the speech a poem.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is a mistake to say that Browning is a metaphysical
poet: he is a psychological poet. His interest
does not lie in the abstract problems of time
and space, mind and matter, divinity and humanity.
It lies in the concrete problems of opportunity
and crisis, flesh and spirit, man the individual and
God the person. He is an anatomist of souls.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Take the least man of all mankind, as I;</div>
<div class="verse">Look at his head and heart, find how and why</div>
<div class="verse">He differs from his fellows utterly.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But his way of finding out this personal equation
is not by observation and reflection. It is by throwing
himself into the character and making it reveal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
itself by intricate self-analysis or by impulsive action.
What his poetry lacks is the temperate zone.
He has the arctic circle of intellect and the tropics
of passion. But he seldom enters the intermediate
region of sentiment, reflection, sympathy, equable
and prolonged feeling. Therefore it is that few of
his poems have the power of “sinking inward from
thought to thought” as Wordsworth’s do. They
surprise us, rouse us, stimulate us, more than they
rest us. He does not penetrate with a mild and
steady light through the portals of the human heart,
making them transparent. He flings them wide
open suddenly, and often the gates creak on their
hinges. He is forever tying Gordian knots in the
skein of human life and cutting them with the sword
of swift action or intense passion. His psychological
curiosity creates the difficulties, his intuitive optimism
solves them.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The results of this preoccupation with such subjects
and of this manner of dealing with them may
be recognized very easily in Browning’s work.</p>

<p>First of all they turned him aside from becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
a great Nature-poet, though he was well fitted to
be one. It is not that he loves Nature’s slow and
solemn pageant less, but that he loves man’s quick
and varied drama more. His landscapes are like
scenery for the stage. They accompany the unfolding
of the plot and change with it, but they do
not influence it. His observation is as keen, as accurate
as Wordsworth’s or Tennyson’s, but it is
less steady, less patient, less familiar. It is the observation
of one who passes through the country
but does not stay to grow intimate with it. The
forms of nature do not print themselves on his mind;
they flash vividly before him, and come and go.
Usually it is some intense human feeling that makes
the details of the landscape stand out so sharply.
In <cite>Pippa Passes</cite>, it is in the ecstasy of love that
Ottima and Sebald notice</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The garden’s silence: even the single bee</div>
<div class="verse">Persisting in his toil, suddenly stopped,</div>
<div class="verse">And where he hid you only could surmise</div>
<div class="verse">By some campanula chalice set a-swing.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is the sense of guilty passion that makes the
lightning-flashes, burning through the pine-forest,
seem like dagger-strokes,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“As if God’s messenger through the closed wood screen</div>
<div class="verse">Plunged and re-plunged his weapon at a venture,</div>
<div class="verse">Feeling for guilty thee and me.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In <cite>Home Thoughts from Abroad</cite>, it is the exile’s deep
homesickness that brings the quick, delicate vision
before his eyes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Oh, to be in England</div>
<div class="verse">Now that April’s there,</div>
<div class="verse">And whoever wakes in England</div>
<div class="verse">Sees, some morning, unaware,</div>
<div class="verse">That the lowest boughs and the brush-wood sheaf</div>
<div class="verse">Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,</div>
<div class="verse">While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough</div>
<div class="verse">In England—now!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Browning’s touches of nature are not always
as happy as this. Often he crowds the details too
closely, and fails to blend them with the ground of
the picture, so that the tonality is destroyed and
the effect is distracting. The foreground is too
vivid: the aerial perspective vanishes. There is
an impressionism that obscures the reality. As
Amiel says: “Under pretense that we want to study
it more in detail, we pulverize the statue.”</p>

<p>Browning is at his best as a Nature-poet in sky-scapes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
like the description of daybreak in <cite>Pippa
Passes</cite>, the lunar rainbow in <cite>Christmas Eve</cite>, and the
Northern Lights in <cite>Easter Day</cite>; and also in a kind
of work which might be called symbolic landscape,
where the imaginative vision of nature is made to
represent a human experience. A striking example
of this work is the scenery of <cite>Childe Roland</cite>, reflecting
as in a glass the grotesque horrors of spiritual
desolation. There is a passage in <cite>Sordello</cite> which
makes a fertile landscape, sketched in a few swift
lines, the symbol of Sordello’s luxuriant nature;
and another in Norbert’s speech, in <cite>In a Balcony</cite>,
which uses the calm self-abandonment of the world
in the tranquil evening light as the type of the sincerity
of the heart giving itself up to love. But
perhaps as good an illustration as we can find of
Browning’s quality as a Nature-poet, is a little bit
of mystery called <cite>Meeting at Night</cite>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The gray sea and the long black land;</div>
<div class="verse">And the yellow half-moon, large and low;</div>
<div class="verse">And the startled little waves that leap</div>
<div class="verse">In fiery ringlets from their sleep,</div>
<div class="verse">As I gain the cove with pushing prow,</div>
<div class="verse">And quench its speed in the slushy sand.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;</div>
<div class="verse">Three fields to cross till a farm appears;</div>
<div class="verse">A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch</div>
<div class="verse">And the blue spirt of a lighted match,</div>
<div class="verse">And a voice less loud, through its joys and fears,</div>
<div class="verse">Than the two hearts beating each to each!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is the landscape of the drama.</p>

<p>A second result of Browning’s preoccupation
with dramatic psychology is the close concentration
and “alleged obscurity” of his style. Here again
I evade the critical question whether the obscurity
is real, or whether it is only a natural and admirable
profundity to which an indolent reviewer has given
a bad name. That is a question which Posterity
must answer. But for us the fact remains that
some of his poetry is hard to read; it demands close
attention and strenuous effort; and when we find
a piece of it that goes very easily, like <cite>The Pied
Piper of Hamelin</cite>, <cite>How They brought the Good News
from Ghent to Aix</cite>, <cite>Hervé Riel</cite>, or the stirring <cite>Cavalier
Tunes</cite>, we are conscious of missing the sense of strain
which we have learned to associate with the reading
of Browning.</p>

<p>One reason for this is the predominance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
curiosity over harmony in his disposition. He tries
to express the inexpressible, to write the unwritable.
As Dr. Johnson said of Cowley, he has the
habit “of pursuing his thoughts to the last ramifications,
by which he loses the grandeur of generality.”
Another reason is the fluency, the fertility,
the haste of his genius, and his reluctance, or inability,
to put the brakes on his own productiveness.</p>

<p>It seems probable that if Browning had been able
to write more slowly and carefully he might have
written with more lucidity. There was a time when
he made a point of turning off a poem a day. It
is doubtful whether the story of <cite>The Ring and the
Book</cite> gains in clearness by being told by eleven different
persons, all of them inclined to volubility.</p>

<p>Yet Browning’s poetry is not verbose. It is singularly
condensed in the matter of language. He seems
to have made his most arduous effort in this direction.
After <cite>Paracelsus</cite> had been published and
pronounced “unintelligible,” he was inclined to
think that there might be some fault of too great
terseness in the style. But a letter from Miss Caroline
Fox was shown to him, in which that lady, (then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
very young,) took the opposite view and asked
“doth he know that Wordsworth will devote a fortnight
or more to the discovery of the single word
that is the one fit for his sonnet.” Browning appears
to have been impressed by this criticism;
but he set himself to work upon it, not so much by
way of selecting words as by way of compressing
them. He put <cite>Sordello</cite> into a world where many of
the parts of speech are lacking and all are crowded.
He learned to pack the largest, possible amount of
meaning into the smallest possible space, as a hasty
traveller packs his portmanteau. Many small articles
are crushed and crumpled out of shape. He
adopted a system of elisions for the sake of brevity,
and loved, as C. S. Calverley said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“to dock the smaller parts of speech</div>
<div class="verse">As we curtail th’ already curtailed cur.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At the same time he seldom could resist the temptation
to put in another thought, another simile, another
illustration, although the poem might be already
quite full. He called out, like the conductor
of a street-car, “Move up in front: room for one
more!” He had little tautology of expression, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
much of conception. A good critic says “Browning
condenses by the phrase, elaborates by the
volume.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>One consequence of this system of writing is that
a great deal of Browning’s poetry lends itself admirably
to translation,—into English. The number
of prose paraphrases of his poems is great, and
so constantly increasing that it seems as if there
must be a real demand for them. But Coleridge,
speaking of the qualities of a true poetic style, remarked:
“Whatever lines can be translated into
other words of the same language without diminution
of their significance, either in sense, or in association,
or in any other feeling, are so far vicious in
their diction.”</p>

<p>Another very notable thing in Browning’s poetry
is his fertility and fluency of rhyme. He is probably
the most rapid, ingenious, and unwearying rhymer
among the English poets. There is a story that
once, in company with Tennyson, he was challenged
to produce a rhyme for “rhinoceros,” and almost
instantly accomplished the task with a verse in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
which the unwieldy quadruped kept time and tune
with the phrase “he can toss Eros.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> There are
other <i lang="fr">tours de force</i> almost as extraordinary in his
serious poems. Who but Browning would have
thought of rhyming “syntax” with “tin-tacks,” or
“spare-rib” with “Carib,” (<cite>Flight of Duchess</cite>) or
“Fra Angelico’s” with “bellicose,” or “Ghirlandajo”
with “heigh-ho,” (<cite>Old Pictures in Florence</cite>) or
“expansive explosive” with “O Danaides, O Sieve!”
(<cite>Master Hugues</cite>). Rhyme, with most poets, acts as
a restraint, a brake upon speech. But with Browning
it is the other way. His rhymes are like wild,
frolicsome horses, leaping over the fences and carrying
him into the widest digressions. Many a couplet,
many a stanza would not have been written but
for the impulse of a daring, suggestive rhyme.</p>

<p>Join to this love of somewhat reckless rhyming,
his deep and powerful sense of humour, and you
have the secret of his fondness for the grotesque.
His poetry abounds in strange contrasts, sudden
changes of mood, incongruous comparisons, and
odd presentations of well-known subjects. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the whole poem is written in this manner.
The <cite>Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister</cite>, <cite>Sibrandus Schafnaburgensis</cite>,
and <cite>Caliban upon Setebos</cite>, are poetic
gargoyles. Sometimes he begins seriously enough,
as in the poem on Keats, and closes with a bit of
fantastic irony:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Hobbs hints blue,—straight he turtle eats:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nobbs prints blue,—claret crowns his cup:</div>
<div class="verse">Nokes outdares Stokes in azure feats—</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Both gorge. Who fished the murex up?</div>
<div class="verse">What porridge had John Keats?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Sometimes the poem opens grotesquely, like <cite>Christmas
Eve</cite>, and rises swiftly to a wonderful height of
pure beauty and solemnity, dropping back into a
grotesque at the end. But all this play of fancy
must not be confused with the spirit of mockery or
of levity. It is often characteristic of the most serious
and earnest natures; it arises in fact from the
restlessness of mind in the contemplation of evil,
or from the perception of life’s difficulties and perplexities.
Shakespeare was profoundly right in introducing
the element of the grotesque into <cite>Hamlet</cite>,
his most thoughtful tragedy. Browning is never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
really anything else but a serious thinker, passionately
curious to solve the riddle of existence. Like
his own <cite>Sordello</cite> he</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Gave to familiar things a face grotesque,</div>
<div class="verse">Only, pursuing through the mad burlesque,</div>
<div class="verse">A grave regard.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We may sum up, then, what we have to say of
Browning’s method and manner by recognizing
that they belong together and have a mutual fitness
and inevitableness. We may wish that he had attained
to more lucidity and harmony of expression,
but we should probably have had some difficulty
in telling him precisely how to do it, and he would
have been likely to reply with good humour as he
did to Tennyson, “The people must take me as
they find me.” If he had been less ardent in looking
for subjects for his poetry, he might have given
more care to the form of his poems. If he had cut
fewer blocks, he might have finished more statues.
The immortality of much of his work may be discounted
by its want of perfect art,—the only true
preservative of man’s handiwork. But the immortality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>of his genius is secure. He may not be ranked
finally among the great masters of the art of poetry.
But he certainly will endure as a mine for poets.
They may stamp the coins more clearly and fashion
the ornaments more delicately. But the gold is
his. He was the prospector,—the first dramatic
psychologist of modern life. The very imperfections
of his work, in all its splendid richness and
bewildering complexity, bear witness to his favourite
doctrine that life itself is more interesting than
art, and more glorious, because it is not yet perfect.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>“The Glory of the Imperfect,”—that is a phrase
which I read in a pamphlet by that fine old Grecian
and noble Christian philosopher, George Herbert
Palmer, many years ago. It seems to me to express
the central meaning of Browning’s poetry.</p>

<p>He is the poet of aspiration and endeavour; the
prophet of a divine discontent. All things are precious
to him, not in themselves, but as their defects
are realized, as man uses them, and presses through
them, towards something higher and better. Hope
is man’s power: and the things hoped for must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
as yet unseen. Struggle is man’s life; and the purpose
of life is not merely education, but a kind of
progressive creation of the soul.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Man partly is and wholly hopes to be.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The world presents itself to him, as the Germans
say, <i lang="de">Im Werden</i>. It is a world of potencies, working
itself out. Existence is not the mere fact of being,
but the vital process of becoming. The glory of
man lies in his power to realize this process in his
mind and to fling himself into it with all his will.
If he tries to satisfy himself with things as they are,
like the world-wedded soul in <cite>Easter Eve</cite>, he fails.
If he tries to crowd the infinite into the finite, like
Paracelsus, he fails. He must make his dissatisfaction
his strength. He must accept the limitations
of his life, not in the sense of submitting to
them, but as Jacob wrestled with the angel, in order
to win, through conflict, a new power, a larger blessing.
His ardent desires and longings and aspirations,
yes, even his defeats and disappointments and
failures, are the stuff out of which his immortal
destiny is weaving itself. The one thing that life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
requires of him is to act with ardour, to go forward
resolutely, to “burn his way through the world”;
and the great lesson which it teaches him is this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“But thou shalt painfully attain to joy</div>
<div class="verse">While hope and love and fear shall keep thee man.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Browning was very much needed in the Nineteenth
Century as the antidote, or perhaps it would
be more just to say, as the complement to Carlyle.
For Carlyle’s prophecy, with all its moral earnestness,
its virility, its indomitable courage, had in it
a ground-tone of despair. It was the battle-cry of
a forlorn hope. Man must hate shams intensely,
must seek reality passionately, must do his duty
desperately; but he can never tell why. The reason
of things is inscrutable: the eternal Power that
rules things is unknowable. Carlyle, said Mazzini,
“has a constant disposition to crush the human by
comparing him with God.” But Browning has an
unconquerable disposition to elevate the human by
joining him to God. The power that animates and
governs the world is Divine; man cannot escape
from it nor overcome it. But the love that stirs
in man’s heart is also Divine; and if man will follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
it, it shall lead him to that height where he
shall see that Power is Love.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I have faith such end shall be:</div>
<div class="verse indent1">From the first Power was—I knew.</div>

<div class="verse indent1">That, strive but for closer view,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Browning’s optimism is fundamental. Originally
a matter of temperament, perhaps, as it is expressed
in <cite>At the Mermaid</cite>,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I find earth not gray, but rosy,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Heaven not grim but fair of hue.</div>
<div class="verse">Do I stoop? I pluck a posy,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Do I stand and stare? All’s blue——”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">primarily the spontaneous tone of a healthy, happy
nature, it became the chosen key-note of all his
music, and he works it out through a hundred harmonies
and discords. He is “sure of goodness as
of life.” He does not ask “How came good into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the world?” For that, after all, is the pessimistic
question; it assumes that the ground of things is
evil and the good is the breaking of the rule. He
asks instead “How came evil into the world?” That
is the optimistic question; as long as a man puts
it in that form he is an optimist at heart; he takes
it for granted that good is the native element and
evil is the intruder; there must be a solution of the
problem whether he can find it or not; the rule
must be superior to, and triumphant over, the exception;
the meaning and purpose of evil must somehow, some
time, be proved subordinate to good.</p>

<p>That is Browning’s position:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“My own hope is, a sun will pierce</div>
<div class="verse">The thickest cloud earth ever stretched;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That, after Last, returns the First,</div>
<div class="verse">Though a wide compass round be fetched;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That what began best, can’t end worst,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor what God blessed once prove accurst.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The way in which he justifies this position is characteristic
of the man. His optimism is far less defensive
than it is militant. He never wavers from his intuitive
conviction that “the world means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
good.” He follows this instinct as a soldier follows
his banner, into whatever difficulties and conflicts
it may lead him, and fights his way out, now with
the weapons of philosophy, now with the bare
sword of faith.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It might seem at first as if it were unfair to attempt
any estimate of the philosophic and religious
teaching of a poet like Browning, whose method
we have already recognized as dramatic. Can we
ascribe to the poet himself the opinions which he
puts into the mouths of his characters? Can we
hold him responsible for the sentiments which are
expressed by the actors on his stage?</p>

<p>Certainly this objection must be admitted as a
restraint in the interpretation of his poetry. We
are not to take all that his characters say, literally
and directly, as his own belief, any more than we
are to read the speeches of Satan, and Eliphaz, and
Bildad, and Zophar, in the Book of Job, as utterances
of the spirit of inspiration. But just as that
great dramatic Scripture, dealing with the problems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of evil and suffering and sovereignty, does contain
a doctrine and convey a lesson, so the poetry of
Browning, taken as a whole, utters a distinct and
positive prophetic message.</p>

<p>In the first place, many of the poems are evidently
subjective, written without disguise in the
first person. Among these we may consider <cite>My
Star</cite>; <cite>By the Fireside</cite>; <cite>One Word More</cite>; the Epilogues
to <cite>Dramatis Personæ</cite> and <cite>Pachiarrotto</cite> and <cite>Ferishtah’s
Fancies</cite>; the introduction and the close of
<cite>The Ring and the Book</cite>; <cite>Christmas Eve</cite> and <cite>Easter
Day</cite>; the ending of the poem called <cite>Gold Hair</cite>,
and of <cite>A Death in the Desert</cite>, and of <cite>Bishop Blougram’s
Apology</cite>; <cite>Prospice</cite> and <cite>Reverie</cite>. In the second
place we must remember Goethe’s dictum:
“Every author in some degree, pourtrays himself in
his works, even be it against his will.” Even when
Browning is writing dramatically, he cannot conceal
his sympathy. The masks are thin. His eyes
shine through. “His own personality,” says Mr.
Stedman, “is manifest in the speech and movement
of almost every character of each piece. His spirit
is infused as if by metempsychosis, within them all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and forces each to assume a strange Pentecostal
tone, which we discover to be that of the poet himself.”
Thus it is not impossible, nor even difficult,
to reach a fair estimate of his ethical and religious
teaching and discover its principal elements.</p>

<p>1. First among these I would put a great confidence
in God. Browning is the most theological
of modern poets. The epithet which was applied
to Spinoza might well be transferred to him. He
is a “God-intoxicated” man. But in a very different
sense, for whereas the philosopher felt God as
an idea, the poet feels Him intensely as a person.
The song which he puts into the lips of the unconscious
heroine in <cite>Pippa Passes</cite>,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“God’s in his heaven</div>
<div class="verse">All’s right with the world,——”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is the recurrent theme of his poetry. He cries with
Paracelsus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“God thou art Love, I build my faith on that.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Even when his music is broken and interrupted by
discords, when it seems to dissolve and fade away
as all human work, in its outward form, dissolves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and fades, he turns, as Abt Vogler turns from his
silent organ, to God;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Therefore to whom turn I but to thee, the ineffable Name?</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Builder and maker, thou, of houses not made with hands!</div>
<div class="verse">What, have fear of change from thee who art ever the same?</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Doubt that thy power can fill the heart that thy power expands?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In <cite>Rabbi Ben Ezra</cite> he takes up the ancient figure
of the potter and the clay and uses it to express
his boundless trust in God.</p>

<p>The characteristic mark of Browning’s view of
God is that it is always taken from the side of humanity.
The Perfect Glory is the correlative of
the glory of the imperfect. The Divine Love is
the answer to the human longing. God is, because
man needs Him. From this point of view it almost
seems, as a brilliant essayist has said, as if “In
Browning, God is adjective to man.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>But it may be said in answer, that, at least for
man, this is the only point of view that is accessible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
We can never leave our own needs behind us, however
high we may try to climb. Certainly if we
succeed in forgetting them for a moment, in that
very moment we have passed out of the region of
poetry, which is the impassioned interpretation of
man’s heart.</p>

<p>2. The second element of power in Browning’s
poetry is that he sees in the personal Christ the
very revelation of God that man’s heart most needs
and welcomes. Nowhere else in all the range of
modern poetry has this vision been expressed with
such spiritual ardour, with such poignant joy. We
must turn back to the pages of Isaiah to find anything
to equal the Messianic rapture of the minstrel
in <cite>Saul</cite>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“He who did most shall bear most: the strongest shall stand the most weak.</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis the weakness in strength that I cry for! my flesh that I seek</div>
<div class="verse">In the Godhead! I seek and I find it. O Saul, it shall be,</div>
<div class="verse">A Face like my face that receives thee; a man like to me,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou shalt love and be loved by, forever: a Hand like this hand</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Shall throw open the gates of new life to thee! see the Christ stand!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We must look into the Christ-filled letters of St.
Paul to find the attractions of the Crucified One
uttered as powerfully as they are in the <cite>Epistle of
Karshish</cite>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The very God! think Abib; dost thou think?</div>
<div class="verse">So, the All-great, were the All-Loving too—</div>
<div class="verse">So, through the thunder comes a human voice</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, ‘O heart I made, a heart beats here!</div>
<div class="verse">Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself!</div>
<div class="verse">Thou hast no power, nor mayest conceive of mine,</div>
<div class="verse">But love I gave thee, with myself to love,</div>
<div class="verse">And thou must love me who have died for thee!’”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is idle to assert that these are only dramatic
presentations of the Christian faith. No poet could
have imagined such utterances without feeling their
significance; and the piercing splendour of their
expression discloses his sympathy. He reveals it
yet more unmistakably in <cite>Christmas Eve</cite>, (strophe
XVII) and in <cite>Easter Day</cite>, (strophe XXX.) In the
Epilogue to <cite>Dramatis Personæ</cite> it flashes out clearly.
The second speaker, as Renan, has bewailed the
vanishing of the face of Christ from the sorrowful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
vision of the race. The third speaker, the poet
himself, answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“That one Face, far from vanish, rather grows,</div>
<div class="verse">Or decomposes but to recompose</div>
<div class="verse">Become my universe that feels and knows!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">“That face,” said Browning to a friend, “that face
is the face of Christ: that is how I feel Him.”</p>

<p>Surely this is the religious message that the world
most needs to-day. More and more everything in
Christianity hangs upon the truth of the Incarnation.
The alternative declares itself. Either no
God whom we can know and love at all, or God
personally manifest in Christ!</p>

<p>3. The third religious element in Browning’s
poetry is his faith that this life is a probation, a discipline
for the future. He says, again and again,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“I count life just a stuff</div>
<div class="verse">To try the soul’s strength on, educe the man.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The glory of the imperfect lies in the power of progress,
“man’s distinctive mark.” And progress comes
by conflict; conflict with falsehood and ignorance,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Living here means nescience simply; ’tis next life that helps to learn—”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and conflict with evil,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Why comes temptation but for man to meet,</div>
<div class="verse">And master and make crouch beneath his foot,</div>
<div class="verse">And so be pedestalled in triumph?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The poet is always calling us to be glad we are engaged
in such a noble strife.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“Rejoice we are allied</div>
<div class="verse indent6">To that which doth provide</div>
<div class="verse">And not partake, effect and not receive!</div>
<div class="verse indent6">A spark disturbs our clod;</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Nearer we hold of God</div>
<div class="verse">Who gives, than of his tribes that take, I must believe.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">Then welcome each rebuff</div>
<div class="verse indent6">That turns earth’s smoothness rough,</div>
<div class="verse">Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go!</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Be our joys three-parts pain!</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Strive and hold cheap the strain;</div>
<div class="verse">Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Now this is fine doctrine, lofty, strenuous, stimulating.
It appeals to the will, which is man’s central
power. It proclaims the truth that virtue must be
active in its essence though it may also be passive
in its education, positive in its spirit and negative
only by contrast.</p>

<p>But it is in the working out of this doctrine into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
an ethical system that Browning enters upon dangerous
ground, and arrives at results which seem to
obscure the clearness, and to threaten the stability
of the moral order, by which alone, if the world’s
greatest teachers have been right, the ultimate good
of humanity can be attained. Here, it seems to
me, his teaching, especially in its latter utterances,
is often confused, turbulent, misleading. His light
is mixed with darkness. He seems almost to say
that it matters little which way we go, provided
only we go.</p>

<p>He overlooks the deep truth that there is an activity
of the soul in self-restraint as well as in self-assertion.
It takes as much courage to dare not to
do evil as it does to dare to do good. The hero is
sometimes the man who stands still. Virtue is
noblest when it is joined to virility. But virility
alone is not virtue nor does it always lead to moral
victory. Sometimes it leads straight towards moral
paralysis, death, extinction. Browning fails to see
this, because his method is dramatic and because
he dramatizes through himself. He puts himself
into this or the other character, and works himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
out through it, preserving still in himself, though
all unconsciously, the soul of something good. Thus
he does not touch that peculiar deadening of spiritual
power which is one result of the unrestrained
following of impulse and passion. It is this defect
in his vision of life that leads to the dubious and
interrogatory moral of such a poem as <cite>The Statue
and the Bust</cite>.</p>

<p>Browning values the individual so much that he
lays all his emphasis upon the development of
stronger passions and aspirations, the unfolding of
a more vivid and intense personality, and has comparatively
little stress to lay upon the larger thought
of the progress of mankind in harmony and order.
Indeed he poetizes so vigorously against the conventional
judgments of society that he often seems
to set himself against the moral sentiments on which
those conventional judgments, however warped,
ultimately rest. “Over and over again in Browning’s
poetry,” says a penetrating critic, “we meet
with this insistence on the value of moments of
high excitement, of intense living, of full experience
of pleasure, even though such moments be of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
essence of evil and fruitful in all dark consequences.”</p>

<p>Take for example his treatment of love. He is
right in saying “Love is best.” But is he right in
admitting, even by inference, that love has a right
to take its own way of realizing itself? Can love
be at its best unless it is obedient to law? Does it
not make its truest music when it keeps its place
in the harmony of purity and peace and good living?
Surely the wild and reckless view of love as
its own law which seems to glimmer through the
unconsumed smoke of Browning’s later poems,
such as <cite>Fifine at the Fair</cite>, <cite>The Inn Album</cite>, and <cite>Red
Cotton Nightcap Country</cite>, needs correction by a true
flash of insight like that which we find in two lines
of <cite>One Word More</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“<em>Dante, who loved well because he hated,</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>Hated wickedness that hinders loving.</em>”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Browning was at times misled by a perilous philosophy
into a position where the vital distinction
between good and evil dissolved away in a cloud
of unreality. In <cite>Ferishtah’s Fancies</cite> and <cite>Parleyings
with Certain People of Importance</cite>, any one who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the patience to read them will find himself in a nebulous
moral world. The supposed necessity of showing
that evil is always a means to good tempts to
the assertion that it has no other reality. Perhaps
it is altogether an illusion, needed to sting us into
conflict, but really non-existent. Perhaps it is only
the shadow cast by the good,—or “the silence implying
sound.” Perhaps it is good in disguise, not
yet developed from the crawling worm into the
creature with wings. After this fashion the whimsical
dervish Ferishtah strews his beans upon the
table.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“This bean was white, this—black,</div>
<div class="verse">Set by itself,—but see if good and bad</div>
<div class="verse">Each following other in companionship,</div>
<div class="verse">Black have not grown less black and white less white,</div>
<div class="verse">Till blackish seems but dun, and whitish,—gray,</div>
<div class="verse">And the whole line turns—well, or black to thee</div>
<div class="verse">Or white alike to me—no matter which.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Certainly if this were the essence of Browning’s
poetry the best safeguard against its falsehood would
be its own weakness. Such a message, if this were
all, could never attract many hearers, nor inspire
those whom it attracted. Effort, struggle, noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
conflict would be impossible in a world where there
were no moral certainties or realities, but all men
felt that they were playing at a stupid game like the
Caucus race in <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite>, where everything
went round in a circle and every runner received
a prize.</p>

<p>But in fact these elements of weakness in Browning’s
work, as it seems to me, do not belong to his
true poetry. They are expressed, generally, in his
most obfuscated style, and at a prohibitory length.
They are embodied in poems which no one is likely
to read for fun, and few are capable of learning by
heart.</p>

<p>But when we go back to his best work we find
another spirit, we hear another message. Clear,
resonant, trumpet-like his voice calls to us proclaiming
the glorious possibilities of this imperfect
life. Only do not despair; only do not sink down
into conventionality, indifference, mockery, cynicism;
only rise and hope and go forward out of the
house of bondage into the land of liberty. True,
the prophecy is not complete. But it is inspiring.
He does not teach us how to live. But he does tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
us to live,—with courage, with love to man, with
trust in God,—and he bids us find life glorious,
because it is still imperfect and therefore full of
promise.</p>

<p>In April, 1653, Oliver Cromwell, after much bloodshed
and amid great confusion, violently dissolved
the “Rump Parliament.” In May of the same
year, Izaak Walton published <cite>The Compleat Angler,
or the Contemplative Man’s Recreation</cite>. ’Twas a
strange contrast between the tranquil book and the
tempestuous time. But that the contrast was not
displeasing may be inferred from the fact that five
editions were issued during the author’s life, which
ended in 1683, at the house of his son-in-law in the
cathedral close at Winchester, Walton being then in
his ninety-first year and at peace with God and
man.</p>

<p>Doubtless one of the reasons why those early editions,
especially the first, the second, and the fifth,
(in which Walton’s friend Charles Cotton added his
“Instructions How to Angle for a Trout or Grayling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
in a Clear Stream,”) are now become so rare and
costly, is because they were carried about by honest
anglers of the 17th Century in their coat-pockets or
in their wallets, a practice whereby the body of a
book is soon worn out, though its soul be immortal.</p>

<p>That this last is true of Walton’s <cite>Angler</cite> seems
proven by its continual reappearance. The Hundredth
Edition (called after the rivers Lea and
Dove, which Walton loved) was brought out in
1888, by the genial fisherman and bibliophile, R. B.
Marston of the London <cite>Fishing Gazette</cite>. Among the
other English editions I like John Major’s second
(1824); and Sir John Hawkins’, reissued by Bagster
(1808); and Pickering’s richly illustrated two volumes
edited by Sir Harris Nicolas (1836). There is
a 32mo reprint by the same publisher, (and a “diamond”
from the Oxford University Press,) small
enough to go comfortably in a vest-pocket with
your watch or your pipe. I must speak also of the
admirable introductions to the <cite>Angler</cite> written in
these latter years by James Russell Lowell, Andrew
Lang, and Richard Le Gallienne; and of the great
American edition made by the Reverend Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
George W. Bethune in 1847, a work in which the
learning, wit, and sympathy of the editor illuminate
the pages. This edition is already hard to find, but
no collector of angling books would willingly go
without it.</p>

<p>The gentle reader has a wide choice, then, of the
form in which he will take his Walton,—something
rare and richly adorned for the library, or something
small and plain for the pocket or the creel. But in
what shape soever he may choose to read the book,
if he be not “a severe, sour-complexioned man” he
will find it good company. There is a most propitiating
paragraph in the “Address” at the beginning
of the first edition. Explaining why he has introduced
“some innocent harmless mirth” into his
work, Walton writes:</p>

<p>“I am the willinger to justify this innocent mirth
because the whole discourse is a kind of picture of
my own disposition, at least of my disposition in
such days and times as I allow myself, when honest
<i>Nat.</i> and <i>R.R.</i> and I go a-fishing together.”</p>

<p>This indeed is one of the great attractions of the
book, that it so naturally and simply shows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
author. I know of no other in which this quality of
self-revelation without pretense or apology is as
modest and engaging,—unless it be the <cite>Essays</cite> of
Charles Lamb, or those of M. de Montaigne. We
feel well acquainted with Walton when we have
read the <cite>Angler</cite>, and perhaps have added to our
reading his only other volume,—a series of brief
<cite>Lives</cite> of certain excellent and beloved men of his
time, wherein he not only portrays their characters
but further discloses his own. They were men of
note in their day: Sir Henry Wotton, ambassador to
Venice; Dr. John Donne, Dean of St. Paul’s; Richard
Hooker, famous theologian; George Herbert,
sacred poet; Bishop Sanderson, eminent churchman.
With most of these, and with other men of like
standing, Walton was in friendship. The company
he kept indicates his quality. Whatever his
occupation or his means, he was certainly a gentleman
and a scholar, as well as a good judge of fishing.</p>

<p>Of the actual events of his life, despite diligent
research, little is known, and all to his credit. Perhaps
there were no events of public importance or
interest. He came as near as possible to the fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
estate of the nation which has a good repute
but no history.</p>

<p>He was born in the town of Stafford, August 9th,
1593. Of his schooling he speaks with becoming
modesty; and it must have been brief, for at the
age of sixteen or seventeen he was an apprentice in
London. Whether he was a linendraper or an ironmonger
is a matter of dispute. Perhaps he was first
one and then the other. His first shop, in the Royal
Burse, Cornhill, was about seven and a half feet
long by five wide. But he must have done a good
business in those narrow quarters; for in 1624 he
had a better place on Fleet Street, and from 1628 to
1644 he was a resident of the parish of St. Dunstan’s,
having a comfortable dwelling (and probably
his shop) in Chancery Lane, “about the seventh
house on the left hand side.” He served twice on
the grand jury, and was elected a vestryman of St.
Dunstan’s twice.</p>

<p>It was during his residence here that he lost his
first wife, Rachel Floud, and the seven children
whom she had borne to him. In 1644, finding the
city “dangerous for honest men” on account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
civil strife and disorder, he retired from London, and
probably from business, and lived in the country,
“sometimes at Stafford,” (according to Anthony
Wood, the antiquary,) “but mostly in the families
of the eminent clergymen of England, of whom he
was much beloved.” This life gave him large opportunity
for his favourite avocation of fishing, and
widened the circle of his friendships, for wherever he
came as a guest he was cherished as a friend. I
make no doubt that the love of angling, to which
innocent recreation he was attached by a temperate
and enduring passion, was either the occasion or the
promoter of many of these intimacies. For it has
often been observed that this sport inclines those
that practise it to friendliness; and there are no
closer or more lasting companionships than such as
are formed beside flowing streams by men who study
to be quiet and go a-fishing.</p>

<p>After his second marriage, about 1646, to Anne
Ken, half-sister of Bishop Thomas Ken, (author of
the well-known hymns, “Awake, my soul, and with
the sun,” and “All praise to Thee, my God, this
night,”) Walton went to live for some years at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Clerkenwell. While he was there, the book for
which he had been long preparing, <cite>The Compleat
Angler</cite>, was published, and gave him his sure place
in English literature and in the heart of an innumerable
company of readers.</p>

<p>Never was there a better illustration of “fisherman’s
luck” than the success of Walton’s book.
He set out to make a little “discourse of fish and
fishing,” a “pleasant curiositie” he calls it, full of
useful information concerning the history and practice
of the gentle art, and, as the author modestly
claims on his title-page, “not unworthy the perusal
of most anglers.” Instead of this he produced an
imperishable classic, which has been read with delight
by thousands who have never wet a line. It
was as if a man went forth to angle for smelts and
caught a lordly salmon.</p>

<p>As a manual of practical instruction the book is
long since out of date. The kind of rod which Walton
describes is too cumbrous for the modern angler,
who catches his trout with a split bamboo weighing
no more than four or five ounces, and a thin waterproofed
line of silk beside which Father Izaak’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
favourite line twisted of seven horse-hairs would
look like a bed-cord. Most of his recipes for captivating
baits and lures, and his hints about “oyl,”
or “camphire” with which they may be made infallibly
attractive to reluctant fish, are now more
curious than valuable. They seem like ancient
superstitions,—although this very summer I have
had recommended to me a secret magic ointment
one drop of which upon a salmon-fly would (supposedly)
render it irresistible. (Yes, reader, I did
try it; but its actual effect, owing to various incalculable
circumstances, could not be verified.
The salmon took the anointed fly sometimes, but
at other times they took the unanointed, and so I
could not make affidavit that it was the oil that
allured them. It may have been some tickling in
the brain, some dim memory of the time when they
were little parr, living in fresh water for their first
eighteen months and feeding mainly on floating
insects, that made them wish to rise again.)</p>

<p>But to return to my subject. The angler of to-day
who wishes to understand the technics of modern
fishing-gear will go to such books as H. B. Wells’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
<cite>Fly Rods and Fly Tackle</cite>, or to Dr. George Holden’s
<cite>The Idyl of the Split Bamboo</cite>. This very year two
volumes have been published, each of which in its
way goes far beyond Walton: Mr. William Radcliffe’s
<cite>Fishing from the Earliest Times</cite>, which will
undoubtedly take its place as the standard history
of the ancient craft of fish-catching; and Mr. Edward
R. Hewitt’s <cite>Secrets of the Salmon</cite>, a brilliant and
suggestive piece of work, full of acute scientific observation
and successful experiment. These belong
to what De Quincey called “the literature of knowledge.”
But the <cite>Angler</cite> belongs to “the literature of
power,”—that which has a quickening and inspiring
influence upon the spirit,—and here it is unsurpassed,
I may even say unrivalled, by any book ever written
about any sport. Charles Lamb wrote to Coleridge
commending it to his perusal: “It might sweeten a
man’s temper at any time to read <cite>The Compleat
Angler</cite>.”</p>

<p>The unfailing charm of the book lives in its delicately
clear descriptions of the country and of rural
life; in its quaint pastoral scenes, like the interview
with the milkmaid and her mother, and the convocation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of gipsies under the hedge; and in its sincerely
happy incitements to patience, cheerfulness, a contented
spirit, and a tranquil mind.</p>

<p>In its first form the book opened with a dialogue
between Piscator and Viator; but later this was revised
to a three-sided conversation in which Venator,
a hunter, and Auceps, a falconer, take the place
of Viator and try valiantly to uphold the merits of
their respective sports as superior to angling. Of
course Piscator easily gets the best of them, (authors
always have this power to reserve victory for their
favourites,) and Auceps goes off stage, vanquished,
while Venator remains as a convert and willing disciple,
to follow his “Master” by quiet streams and
drink in his pleasant and profitable discourse. As a
dialogue it is not very convincing, it lacks salt
and pepper; Venator is too easy a convert; he makes
two or three rather neat repartees, but in general,
he seems to have no mind of his own. But as a
monologue it is very agreeable, being written in a
sincere, colloquial, unaffected yet not undignified
manner, with a plenty of digressions. And these,
like the by-paths on a journey, are the pleasantest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
parts of all. Piscator’s talk appears easy, unconstrained,
rambling, yet always sure-footed, like the
walk of one who has wandered by the little rivers
so long that he can move forward safely without
watching every step, finding his footing by a kind
of instinct while his eyes follow the water and the
rising fish.</p>

<p>But we must not imagine that such a style as
this, fluent as it seems and easy to read as it is for
any one with an ear for music, either comes by nature
or is attained without effort. Walton speaks
somewhere of his “artless pencil”; but this is true
only in the sense that he makes us forget the processes
of his art in the simplicity of its results. He
was in fact very nice in his selection and ordering of
words. He wrote and rewrote his simplest sentences
and revised his work in each of the five earlier
editions, except possibly the fourth.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the bit which I have already
quoted from the “address to the reader” in the
first edition, and compare it with the corresponding
passage in the fifth edition:</p>

<p>“I am the willinger to justify <i>the pleasant part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
it</i>, because, <i>though it is known I can be serious at
reasonable times</i>, yet the whole discourse is, <i>or rather
was</i>, a picture of my own disposition, <i>especially</i> in
such days and times as I <i>have laid aside business,
and gone a-fishing with</i> honest Nat. and R. Roe; <i>but
they are gone, and with them most of my pleasant
hours, even as a shadow that passeth away and returns
not</i>.”</p>

<p>All the phrases in italics are either altered or
added.</p>

<p>He cites Montaigne’s opinion of cats,—a familiar
judgment expressed with lightness,—and in the first
edition Winds up his quotation with the sentence,
“To this purpose speaks Montaigne concerning
cats.” In the fifth edition this is humourously improved
to, “Thus <em>freely</em> speaks Montaigne concerning
cats,”—as if it were something noteworthy to
take a liberty with this petted animal.</p>

<p>The beautiful description of the song of the nightingale,
and of the lark, and the fine passage beginning,
“Every misery that I miss is a new mercy,”
are jewels that Walton added in revision.</p>

<p>In the first edition he gravely tells how the salmon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
“will force themselves over the tops of weirs
and hedges or stops in the water, <em>by taking their
tails into their mouths and leaping over those places</em>,
even to a height beyond common belief.” But
upon reflection this fish-story seems to him dubious;
and so in the later edition you find the mouth-and-tail
legend in a poetical quotation, to which
Walton cautiously adds, “<em>This Michael Drayton
tells you</em> of this leap or summer-salt of the salmon.”</p>

<p>It would be easy to continue these illustrations of
Walton’s care in revising his work through successive
editions; indeed a long article, or even a little
book might be made upon this subject, and if I had
the time I should like to do it.</p>

<p>Another theme would well repay study, and that
is the influence of the King James Version of the
Bible upon his style and thought. That wonderful
example of pure, strong, and stately English prose,
was first printed and published when Walton was
eighteen years old, about the time he came to London
as an apprentice. Yet to such good purpose
did he read and study it that his two books, the
<cite>Angler</cite> and the <cite>Lives</cite>, are full of apt quotations from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
it, and almost every page shows the exemplary
effect of its admirable diction. Indeed it has often
seemed to me that his fine description of the style of
the Prophet Amos, (in the first chapter of the
<cite>Angler</cite>,) reveals something of the manner in which
Walton himself desired to write; and in this desire
he was not altogether unsuccessful.</p>

<p>How clearly the man shines through his book!
An honest, kindly man, not ashamed of his trade,
nor of his amusements, nor of his inmost faith. A
man contented with his modest place in the world,
and never doubting that it was a good world or that
God made it. A firm man, not without his settled
convictions and strong aversions, yet “content that
every reader should enjoy his own opinion.” A liberal-mannered
man, enjoying the music of birds and
of merry songs and glees, grateful for good food,
and “barly-wine, the good liquor that our honest
Fore-fathers did use to drink of,” and a fragrant
pipe afterwards; sitting down to meat not only
with “the eminent clergymen of England,” but
also, (as his Master did,) with publicans and sinners;
and counting among his friends such dignitaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
as Dr. John Hales, Bishop King, and Sir
Henry Wotton, and such lively and vagarious persons
as Ben Jonson, Carey, and Charles Cotton.
A loyal, steadfast man, not given to change, anxiety
of mind, or vain complaining, but holding to
the day’s duty and the day’s reward of joy as God
sent them to him, and bearing the day’s grief with
fortitude. Thus he worked and read and angled
quietly through the stormy years of the Civil War
and the Commonwealth, wishing that men would
beat their swords into fish-hooks, and cast their
leaden bullets into sinkers, and study peace and
the Divine will.</p>

<p>When James Boswell, Esq., wrote <cite>The Life of
Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</cite>, he not only achieved his
purpose of giving the world “a rich intellectual
treasure,” but also succeeded in making himself a
subject of permanent literary interest.</p>

<p>Among the good things which the year 1922
has brought to us I count the <i lang="la">Boswell redivivus</i> from
the industrious and skilful hand of Professor Chauncey
Brewster Tinker of Yale. He calls his excellent
book, which is largely enriched with new material
in the way of hitherto unpublished letters, <cite>Young
Boswell</cite>. This does not mean that he deals only
with the early years, amatory episodes, and first
literary ventures of Johnson’s inimitable biographer,
but that he sees in the man a certain persistent
youngness which accounts for the exuberance of
his faults and follies as well as for the enthusiasm
of his hero-worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Tinker does not attempt to camouflage the
incorrigible absurdities of Boswell’s disposition, nor
the excesses of his conduct, but finds an explanation
if not an excuse for them in the fact that he
had a juvenile temperament which inclined him
all through life to self-esteem and self-indulgence,
and kept him “very much a boy” until he died
of it. Whether this is quite consistent with his
being “in fullest truth a genius,” as Mr. Tinker
claims, may be doubted; for genius in the high
sense is something that ripens if time be given it.
But what is certain beyond a question is that this
vain and vagarious little Scotch laird had in him
a gift of observation, a talent of narration, and
above all a power of generous admiration, which
enabled him to become, by dint of hard work, what
Macaulay entitled him, “the first of biographers.”</p>

<p>Ever since it appeared in 1791, Boswell’s <cite>Life of
Johnson</cite> has been a most companionable book. Reprinted
again and again, it finds a perennial welcome.
To see it in a new edition is no more remarkable
nowadays than it once was to see Dr. Oliver
Goldsmith in a new and vivid waistcoat.
For my own part I prefer it handsomely drest, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
large type, liberal margins, and a-plenty of illustrations.
For it is not a book in which economy of
bulk is needful; it is less suitable for company on
a journey or a fishing-trip, than for a meditative
hour in the library after dinner, or a pleasant wakeful
hour in bed, when the reading-lamp glows clear
and steady, and all the rest of the family are asleep
or similarly engaged in recumbent reading.</p>

<p>There are some books with which we can never
become intimate. However long we may know
them they keep us on the cold threshold of acquaintance.
Others boisterously grasp our hand and drag
us in, only to bore us and make us regret the day
of our introduction. But if there ever was a book
which invited genially to friendship and delight it
is this of Boswell’s. The man who does not know
it is ignorant of some of the best cheer that can
enliven a solitary fireside. The man who does not
enjoy it is insensible alike to the attractions of a
noble character vividly depicted, and to the amusement
afforded by the sight of a great genius in company
with an adoring follower capable, at times,
of acting like an engaging ass.</p>

<p>Yet after all, I have always had my doubts about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the supposed “asininity” of Boswell. As his Great
Friend said, “A man who talks nonsense so well
must know that he is talking nonsense.” It is only
fair to accept his own explanation and allow that
when he said or did ridiculous things it was, partly
at least, in order to draw out his Tremendous Companion.
Thus we may think with pleasure of Boswell
taking a rise out of Johnson. But we do not
need to imagine Johnson taking a rise out of Boswell;
it was not necessary; he rose of his own accord.
He made a candid record of these diverting
incidents because, though self-complacent, he was
not touchy, and he had sense enough to see that
the sure way to be entirely entertaining is to be
quite frank.</p>

<p>Boswell threw a stone at one bird and brought
down two. His triumphant effort to write the life
of his Immense Hero just as it was, with all its surroundings,
appurtenances, and eccentricities, has
won for himself a singular honour: his proper name
has become a common noun. It is hardly necessary
to use a capital letter when we allude to a boswell.
His pious boast that he had “Johnsonized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the land,” is no more correct than it would be to
say, (and if he were alive he would certainly say it,)
that he had boswellized biography.</p>

<p>The success of the book appears the more remarkable
when we remember that of the seventy-five
years of Samuel Johnson’s life not more than
two years and two months were passed in the society
of James Boswell. Yet one would almost
think that they had been rocked in the same cradle,
or, (if this figure of speech seem irreverent,) that
the Laird of Auchinleck had slept in a little trundle-bed
beside the couch of the Mighty Lexicographer.
I do not mean by this that the record is trivial and
cubicular, but simply that Boswell has put into his
book as much of Johnson as it will hold.</p>

<p>Let no one imagine, however, that a like success
can be secured by following the same recipe with
any chance subject. The exact portraiture of an
insignificant person confers information where there
is no curiosity, and becomes tedious in proportion
as it is precise.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The first thing needful is to catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
a giant for your hero; and in this little world it is
seldom that one like Johnson comes to the net.</p>

<p>What a man he was,—this “old struggler,” as
he called himself,—how uncouth and noble and
genuine and profound,—“a labouring, working
mind; an indolent, reposing body”! What a heart
of fortitude in the bosom of his melancholy, what a
kernel of human kindness within the shell of his
rough manner! He was proud but not vain, sometimes
rude but never cruel. His prejudices were
insular, but his intellect was continental. There
was enough of contradiction in his character to give
it variety, and enough of sturdy faith to give it
unity. It was not easy for him to be good, but it
was impossible for him to be false; and he fought
the battle of life through along his chosen line even
to the last skirmish of mortality.</p>

</div>

<p>I suppose we Americans might harbour a grudge
against him on the score of his opinion of our forefathers.
It is on record that he said of them, during
their little controversy with King George III, that
they were “a race of convicts.” (How exciting it
would have been to hear him say a thing like that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
to the face of George Washington or Benjamin
Franklin! He was quite capable of it.) But we
can afford to laugh at such an <i lang="la">obiter dictum</i> now.
And upon my honesty it offends me less at the present
time than Lionel Lispingly Nutt’s condescending
advice on poetry and politics, or Stutterworth
Bummell’s patronizing half-praise. Let a man
smite us fairly on one cheek, and we can manage
to turn the other,—out of his reach. But if he deals
superciliously with us as “poor relations,” we can
hardly help looking for a convenient and not too
dangerous flight of stairs for his speedy descent.</p>

<p>Johnson may be rightly claimed as a Tory-Democrat
on the strength of his serious saying that “the
interest of millions must ever prevail over that of
thousands,” and the temper of his pungent letter
to Lord Chesterfield. And when we consider also
his side remark in defense of card-playing on the
ground that it “generates kindness and consolidates
society,” we may differ from him in our estimate
of the game, but we cannot deny that in small things
as well as in great he spoke as a liberal friend of
humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>His literary taste was not infallible; in some instances,
(for example his extreme laudation of Sir
John Denham’s poem <cite>Cooper’s Hill</cite>, and his adverse
criticism of Milton’s verse,) it was very bad. In general
you may say that it was based upon theories and
rules which are not really of universal application,
though he conceived them to be so. But his style was
much more the product of his own personality and
genius. Ponderous it often was, but seldom clumsy.
He had the art of saying what he meant in a deliberate,
clear, forceful way. Words arrayed themselves
at his command and moved forward in serried phalanx.
He had the praiseworthy habit of completing
his sentences and building his paragraphs firmly.
It will not do us any good to belittle his merit as a
writer, particularly in this age of slipper-shod and
dressing-gowned English.</p>

<p>His diction was much more varied than people
usually suppose. He could suit his manner to almost
any kind of subject, except possibly the very
lightest. He had a keen sense of the shading of
synonyms and rarely picked the wrong word. Of
antithesis and the balanced sentence he was over-fond;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and this device, intended originally to give
a sharpened emphasis, being used too often, lends
an air of monotony to his writing. Yet it has its
merits too, as may be seen in these extracts from
the fiftieth number of <cite>The Rambler</cite>,—extracts which,
by the way, have some relation to a controversy
still raging:</p>

<p>“Every old man complains of the growing depravity
of the world, of the petulance and insolence
of the rising generation. He recounts the decency
and regularity of former times, and celebrates the
discipline and sobriety of the age in which his youth
was passed; a happy age, which is now no more
to be expected, since confusion has broken in upon
the world and thrown down all the boundaries of
civility and reverence.... It may, therefore,
very reasonably be suspected that the old draw
upon themselves the greatest part of those insults
which they so much lament, and that age is rarely
despised but when it is contemptible.... He that
would pass the latter part of his life with honour
and decency, must, when he is young, consider that
he shall one day be old; and remember, when he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
old, that he has once been young. In youth, he
must lay up knowledge for his support, when his
powers of action shall forsake him; and in age forbear
to animadvert with rigour on faults which
experience only can correct.”</p>

<p>In meaning this is very much the same as Sir
James Barrie’s recent admirable discourse on
“Courage” at the University of St. Andrew’s; but
in manner there is quite a difference.</p>

<p>It is commonly supposed that Dr. Johnson did a
great deal to overload and oppress the English language
by introducing new and awkward words of
monstrous length. His opportunities in that way
were large, but he always claimed that he had used
them with moderation and had not coined above
four or five words. When we note that “peregrinity”
was one of them, we are grateful that he refrained
so much; but when we remember that
“clubbable” was another, we are glad that he did
not refrain altogether. For there is no quality more
easy to recognize and difficult to define than that
which makes a man acceptable in a club; and of
this Dr. Johnson has given us a fine example in his
life and an appropriate name in his word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>I think one reason why he got on so well with
people who differed from him, and why most of the
sensible ones so readily put up with his downright
and often brusque way of expressing his sentiments,
was because they came so evidently from his sincere
and unshakeable conviction that certain things
are true, that they can not be changed, and that
they should not be forgotten. Not only in politics,
but also and more significantly in religion, Samuel
Johnson stands out as a sturdy believer.</p>

<p>This seems the more noteworthy when we consider
the conditions of his life. There is hardly one
among the great men of history who can be called
so distinctively “a man of letters,” undoubtedly
none who has won as high a position and as large
a contemporary influence by sheer strength of pen.
Now the literary life is not generally considered to
be especially favourable to the cultivation of religion;
and Johnson’s peculiar circumstances were
not of a kind to make it more favourable in his case
than usual. He was poor and neglected, struggling
during a great part of his career against the heaviest
odds. His natural disposition was by no means
such as to predispose him to faith. He was afflicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
from childhood with a hypochondriac and irritable
humour; a high, domineering spirit, housed in an
unwieldy and disordered body; plagued by inordinate
physical appetites; inclined naturally to
rely with over-confidence upon the strength and
accuracy of his reasoning powers; driven by his
impetuous temper into violent assertion and controversy;
deeply depressed by his long years of obscurity
and highly elated by his final success,—he
was certainly not one whom we would select as likely
to be a remarkably religious man. Carlyle had less
to embitter him. Goethe had no more to excuse
self-idolatry. And yet, beyond a doubt, Johnson
was a sincere, humble, and, in the main, a consistent
Christian.</p>

<p>Of course, we cannot help seeing that his peculiarities
and faults affected his religion. He was intolerant
in his expression of theological views to a
degree which seems almost ludicrous. We may,
perhaps, keep a straight face and a respectful attitude
when we see him turning his back on the Abbé
Raynal, and refusing to “shake hands with an infidel.”
But when he exclaims in regard to a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
lady who had left the Church of England to become
a Quaker, “I hate the wench and shall ever hate
her; I hate all impudence of a chit; apostasy I
nauseate”; and when he answers the gently expressed
hope of a friend that he and the girl would
meet, after all, in a blessed eternity, by saying,
“Madam, I am not fond of <em>meeting fools anywhere</em>,”
we cannot help joining in the general laughter of
the company to whom he speaks; and as the Doctor
himself finally laughs and becomes cheerful and
entertaining, we feel that it was only the bear in
him that growled,—an honest beast, but sometimes
very surly.</p>

<p>As for his remarkable strictures upon Presbyterianism,
his declaration that he preferred the
Roman Catholic Church, his expressed hope that
John Knox was buried in the highway, and his wish
that a dangerous steeple in Edinburgh might not
be taken down because if it were let alone it might
fall on some of the posterity of John Knox, which,
he said, would be “no great matter,”—if when we
read these things we remember that he was talking
to his Scotch friend Boswell, we get a new idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
the audacity of the great man’s humour. I believe
he even stirred up his natural high-churchism to rise
rampant and roar vigourously, for the pleasure of
seeing Boswell’s eyes stand out, and his neat little
pigtail vibrate in dismay.</p>

<p>There are many other sayings of Johnson’s which
disclose a deeper vein of tolerance; such as that
remark about the essential agreement and trivial
differences of all Christians, and his warm commendation,
on his dying bed, of the sermons of Dr.
Samuel Clarke, a Dissenting minister.</p>

<p>But even suppose we are forced to admit that
Dr. Johnson was lacking in that polished liberality,
that willingness to admit that every other man’s
opinions are as good as his own, which we have come
nowadays to regard as the chief of the theological
virtues; even suppose we must call him “narrow,”
we must admit at the same time that he was “deep”;
he had a profundity of conviction, a sincerity of
utterance which made of his religion something, as
the Germans say, “to take hold of with your hands.”</p>

<p>He had need of a sturdy belief. With that tempestuous,
unruly disposition of his boiling all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
time within him, living in the age of Chesterfield
and Bolingbroke, fighting his way through the world
amid a thousand difficulties and temptations, he
had great need to get a firm grip upon some realities
of religion and hold fast to them as things that
were settled. His first conviction of the truth of
Christianity came to him while he was at Oxford,
through a casual reading of Law’s <cite>Call to the Unconverted</cite>.
There were some years after that, he tells
us, when he was totally regardless of religion. But
sickness and trouble brought it back, “and I hope,”
says he, “that I have never lost it since.”</p>

<p>He was not unwilling to converse with friends at
fitting opportunities in regard to religious subjects,
and no one who heard him could have remained
long in doubt as to the nature of his views. There
was one conversation in particular, on the subject
of the sacrifice of Christ, at the close of which he
solemnly dictated to his friend a brief statement of
his belief, saying finally, “The peculiar doctrine of
Christianity is that of an universal sacrifice and a
perpetual propitiation. Other prophets only proclaimed
the will and the threatenings of God. Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
satisfied his justice.” Again, one calm, bright Sunday
afternoon, when he was in a boat with some
friends upon the sea (I think it was during his journey
to the Hebrides,) he fell into discourse with
Boswell about the fear of death, which was often
very terrible to his mind. He would not admit that
the close of life ought to be regarded with cheerfulness
or indifference, or that a rational man should
be as willing to leave the world as to go out of a
show-room after he has seen it. “No, sir,” said
he, “there is no rational principle by which a man
can die contented, but a trust in the mercy of God
through the merits of Jesus Christ.” He was not
ashamed to say that he was afraid to die. He assumed
no braggadocio before the grave. He was
honest with himself, and he felt that he needed all
the fortitude of a religious faith to meet the hour
of dissolution and the prospect of divine judgment
without flinching. He could never have understood
the attitude of men who saunter as unconcernedly
and airily towards the day of judgment as
if they were going to the play.</p>

<p>But Johnson was by no means given to unseasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
or unreasonable religious discourse. He had
a holy horror of cant, and of unprofitable controversy.
He once said of a friend who was more loquacious
than discreet, “Why, yes, sir; he will
introduce religious discourse without seeing whether
it will end in instruction and improvement, or produce
some profane jest. He would introduce it in
the company of Wilkes, and twenty more <em>such</em>.”</p>

<p>It was Dr. Johnson’s custom to keep a book of
<cite>Prayers and Meditations</cite> for his own private use.
These were printed after his death, and they reveal
to us the sincerity of his inner life as nothing else
could do. Think of the old man kneeling down in
his room before he began the painful labours of a
studious day, and repeating this prayer:—</p>

<p>“<em>Against inquisitive and perplexing thoughts</em>:
O Lord, my Maker and Protector, who hast graciously
sent me into this world to work out my salvation,
enable me to drive from me all such unquiet
and perplexing thoughts as may mislead or hinder
me in the practice of those duties which Thou hast
required. When I behold the works of thy hands,
and consider the course of thy providence, give me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
grace always to remember that thy thoughts are
not my thoughts, nor thy ways my ways. And
while it shall please Thee to continue me in this
world, where much is to be done and little to be
known, teach me by thy Holy Spirit to withdraw
my mind from unprofitable and dangerous inquiries,
from difficulties vainly curious, and doubts impossible
to be solved. Let me rejoice in the light which
Thou hast imparted; let me serve Thee with active
zeal and humble confidence, and wait with patient
expectation for the time in which the soul Thou
receivest shall be satisfied with knowledge. Grant
this, O Lord, for Jesus Christ’s sake. Amen.”</p>

<p>These are honest and sensible petitions. And the
more a man knows, the more devoted he is to serious
and difficult studies, the more he ought to feel the
need of just such a divine defense and guidance.
It is good to be kept on the track. It is wise to mistrust
your own doubts. It is happy to be delivered
from them.</p>

<p>The fundamental quality of Dr. Johnson’s religion
was the sense of reverence. He was never
“known to utter the name of God but on proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
occasions and with due respect.” He approached
the consideration of divine things with genuine solemnity,
and could not tolerate sacred trifling or
pious profanity. He was not ashamed to kneel
where men could see him, although he never courted
their notice; or to pray where men could hear him,
although he did not desire their approbation any
more than he feared their ridicule.</p>

<p>There were grave faults and errors in his conduct.
But no one had so keen a sense of their unworthiness
as the man himself, who was bravely fighting against
them, and sincerely lamenting their recurrence.
They often tripped him and humiliated him, but
they never got him completely down. He righted
himself and went lumbering on. He never sold his
heart to a lie, never confused the evil and the good.
When he sinned he knew it and repented. It gives
us confidence in his sincerity when we see him denying
himself the use of wine because he was naturally
prone to excess, and yet allowing it to his friends
who were able to use it temperately. He was no
puritan; and, on the other hand, he was no slipshod
condoner of vice or suave preacher of moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
indifference. He was a big, honest soul, trying hard
to live straight along the line of duty and to do good
as he found opportunity.</p>

<p>The kindness and generosity of his heart were
known to few save his intimate friends, and not
always appreciated even by those who had most
cause to be grateful to him. The poor broken-down
pensioners with whom he filled his house in later
years, and to whom he alluded playfully as his <i lang="it">seraglio</i>,
were a constant source of annoyance. They
grumbled perpetually and fought like so many cats.
But he would not cast them off any more than he
would turn out his favourite mouser, Hodge, for
whom he used to “go out and buy oysters, lest the
servants having that trouble should take a dislike
to the poor creature.” He gave away a large part
of his income in charity; and, what was still more
generous, he devoted a considerable portion of his
time to counseling young and unsuccessful authors
and, (note this,) <em>reading their manuscripts</em>.</p>

<p>I suppose if one had been a poverty-stricken beginner
at literature, in London of the eighteenth
century, the best thing one could have done would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
have been to find the way to Dr. Johnson’s house
and tell him how the case stood. If he himself had
no money to lend, he would have borrowed it from
some of his friends. And if he could not say anything
encouraging about the manuscripts, he would
have been honest and kind enough to advise the
unhappy aspirant to fame to prefer the life of a
competent shoemaker to that of an incompetent
scribbler.</p>

<p>Much of what was best in the character of Johnson
came out in his friendships. He was as good a
lover as he was a hater. He was loyal to a fault,
and sincere, though never extravagant, in his admirations.</p>

<p>The picture of the old man in his last illness, surrounded
by the friends whom he had cherished so
faithfully, and who now delighted to testify their
respect and affection for him, and brighten his lingering
days with every attention, has little of the
customary horror of a death-bed. It is strange indeed
that he who had always been subject to such
a dread of dying should have found it possible to
meet the hour of dissolution with such composure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
His old friend Sir Joshua Reynolds comes in to bid
him farewell, and Johnson makes three requests
of him,—to forgive him thirty pounds which he had
borrowed from him, to read the Bible, and never
to use his pencil on a Sunday. Good petitions,
which Sir Joshua readily granted, although we cannot
help fearing that he occasionally forgot the
last.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” says the sick man to his physician,
“can I possibly recover? Give me a direct answer.”
Being hard pressed, Dr. Brocklesby confesses that
in his opinion recovery is out of the question.
“Then,” says Johnson, “I will take no more physick,
not even my opiates: for I have prayed that I may
render up my soul to God unclouded.”</p>

<p>And so with kind and thoughtful words to his
servant, and a “God bless you, my dear” to the
young daughter of a friend who stood lingering at
the door of his room, this sturdy old believer went
out to meet the God whom he had tried so honestly
to serve. His life was an amazing victory over
poverty, sickness, and sin. Greatness alone could
not have insured, nor could perseverance alone have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
commanded, three of his good fortunes in this world:
that Sir Joshua Reynolds painted his portrait; that
Boswell wrote his biography; and that <span class="smcap">His Wife</span>
said of him that “he was the most sensible man
she had ever met.”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>A friend of mine, one of the Elder Bookmen of
Harvard, told me some twenty years ago that he
had only once seen Ralph Waldo Emerson vexed
out of his transcendental tranquillity and almost
Olympian calm. It was a Sunday afternoon in Concord,
and the philosopher had been drawn from his
study by an unwonted noise in the house. On the
back porch he found his own offspring and some
children of the neighbours engaged in a romping,
boisterous game. With visible anger he stopped it,
saying, “Even if you have no reverence for the day,
you ought to have enough sense and manners to
respect the traditions of your forefathers.”</p>

<p>Emerson’s puritanism was in the blood. Seven
of his ancestors were ministers of New England
churches of the early type. Among them was Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Bulkley, who left his comfortable parish in Bedfordshire,
England, to become the pastor of “the church
in the wilderness” at Concord, Massachusetts;
Father Samuel Moody of Agamenticus, Maine, who
was such a zealous reformer that he pursued wayward
sinners even into the alehouse to reprove them;
Joseph Emerson of Malden, a “heroic scholar,” who
prayed every night that no descendant of his might
ever be rich; and William Emerson, the patriot
preacher, who died while serving in the army of the
Revolution. These were verily “soldiers of the
Lord,” and from them and women of like stamina
and mettle, Emerson inherited the best of puritan
qualities: independence, sobriety, fearless loyalty to
conscience, strenuous and militant virtue.</p>

<p>But he had also a super-gift which was not theirs.
That which made him different from them, gave
him a larger and more beautiful vision of the world,
led him into ways of thinking and speaking which
to them would have seemed strange and perilous,
(though in conduct he followed the strait and narrow
path,)—in short, that which made him what he
was in himself and to countless other men, a seer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
an inspirer, a singer of new light and courage and
joy, was the gift of poetic imagination and interpretation.
He was a puritan <em>plus</em> poetry.</p>

<p>Graduating from Harvard he began life as a
teacher in a Boston school and afterwards the minister
of a Boston church. But there was something
in his temperament which unfitted him for the service
of institutions. He was a servant of ideas.
To do his best work he needed to feel himself entirely
independent of everything except allegiance
to the truth as God gave him to see it from day to
day. The scholastic routine of a Female Academy
irked him. The social distinctions and rivalries of
city life appeared to him both insincere and tiresome.
Even the mild formulas and regulations of
a Unitarian church seemed to hamper him. He
was a come-outer; he wished to think for himself, to
proclaim his own visions, to act and speak only
from the inward impulse, though always with an
eye to the good of others. So he left his parish in
Boston and became a preacher at large to “these
United States.” His pulpit was the lecture-platform;
his little books of prose and verse carried his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
words to a still larger audience; no man in America
during his life had a more extended or a deeper influence;
he became famous both as an orator and as
a writer; but in fact he was always preaching. As
Lamb said to Coleridge, “I never heard you do
anything else.”</p>

<p>The central word of all his discourse is Self-reliance,—be
yourself, trust yourself, and fear not!
But in order to interpret this rightly one must have
at least an inkling of his philosophy, which was profoundly
religious and essentially poetical. He was
a mystic, an intuitional thinker. He believed that
the whole universe of visible things is only a kind of
garment which covers the real world of invisible ideas
and laws and principles. He believed also that
each man, having a share in the Divine Reason
which is the source of all things, may have a direct
knowledge of truth through his own innate ideas
and intuitive perceptions. Emerson wrote in his
diary, “The highest revelation is that God is in
every man.”</p>

<p>This way of thinking is called transcendentalism,
because it overleaps logic and scientific reasoning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
It is easy to see how such a philosophy might lead
unbalanced persons into wild and queer and absurd
views and practices. And so it did when it struck
the neighbourhood of Boston in the second quarter
of the 19th Century, and began to spread from that
sacred centre.</p>

<p>But with these vagaries Emerson had little sympathy.
His mysticism was strongly tinctured with
common sense, (which also is of divine origin,) and
his orderly nature recoiled from eccentric and irregular
ways. Although for a time he belonged to the
“Transcendental Club,” he frequently said that he
would not be called a transcendentalist, and at
times he made fun, in a mild and friendly spirit, of
the extreme followers of that doctrine. He held as
strongly as any one that the Divine light of reason
in each man is the guide to truth; but he held it
with the important reservation that when this inner
light really shines, free from passion and prejudice,
it will never lead a man away from good judgment
and the moral law. All through his life he navigated
the transcendental sea safely, piloted by a puritan
conscience, warned off the rocks by a keen sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
humour, and kept from capsizing by a solid ballast
of New England prudence.</p>

<p>He was in effect one of the most respected, sagacious,
prosperous and virtuous villagers of Concord.
Some slight departures from common custom he
tranquilly tested and as tranquilly abandoned. He
tried vegetarianism for a while, but gave it up when
he found that it did him no good. He attempted
to introduce domestic democracy by having the servants
sit at table with the rest of the household,
but was readily induced to abandon the experiment
by the protest of his two sensible hired girls against
such an inconvenient arrangement. He began to
practise a theory that manual labour should form
part of the scholar’s life, but was checked by the
personal discovery that hard work in the garden
meant poor work in the study. “The writer shall
not dig,” was his conclusion. Intellectual freedom
was what he chiefly desired; and this he found could
best be attained in an inconspicuous manner of living
and dressing, not noticeably different from that
of the average college professor or country minister.</p>

<p class="caption">RALPH WALDO EMERSON.</p>
<p class="caption-copy"><i>From a photograph by Black, Boston.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Here you see the man “in his habit as he lived,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
(and as thousands of lecture-audiences saw him,)
pictured in the old photograph which illustrates this
chapter. Here is the familiar <i lang="fr">décor</i> of the photographer’s
studio: the curtain draped with a cord and
tassel, the muslin screen background, and probably
that hidden instrument of torture, the “head-rest,”
behind the tall, posed figure. Here are the solemn
“swallow-tail coat,” the conventional cravat, and
the black satin waistcoat. Yet even this antique
“carte de visite,” it seems to me, suggests something
more and greater,—the imperturbable, kindly
presence, the noble face, the angelic look, the serene
manner, the penetrating and revealing quality of
the man who set out to be “a friend to all who
wished to live in the spirit.”</p>

<p>Whatever the titles of his lectures,—<cite>Man the Reformer</cite>,
<cite>The Method of Nature</cite>, <cite>The Conduct of Life</cite>,
<cite>Fate</cite>, <cite>Compensation</cite>, <cite>Prudence</cite>, <cite>The Present Age</cite>,
<cite>Society and Solitude</cite>,—his main theme is always the
same, “namely the infinitude of the private man.”
But this private man of Emerson’s, mark you, is
linked by invisible ties to all Nature and carries in
his breast a spark of the undying fire which is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
God. Hence he is at his best when he feels not
only his personal <em>unity</em> but also his universal <em>community</em>,
when he relies on himself and at the same
time cries</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I yield myself to the perfect whole.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This kind of independence is the truest form of obedience.</p>

<p>The charm of Emerson’s way of presenting his
thought comes from the spirit of poetry in the man.
He does not argue, nor threaten, nor often exhort;
he reveals what he has seen or heard, for you to
make what you will of it. He relies less on syllogisms
than on imagery, symbols, metaphors. His
utterance is as inspirational as the ancient oracle of
Delphi, but he shuns the contortions of the priestess
at that shrine.</p>

<p>The clearness and symmetry of his sentences, the
modulations of his thrilling voice, the radiance of
his fine features and his understanding smile, even
his slight hesitations and pauses over his manuscript
as he read, lent a singular attraction to his speech.
Those who were mistrustful of his views on theology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and the church, listened to him with delight when
he poetized on art, politics, literature, human society
and the natural world. To the finest men and
women of America in the mid-Victorian epoch he
was the lecturer <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>, the intellectual awakener
and liberator, the messenger calling them to
break away from dull, thoughtless, formal ways of
doing things, and live freely in harmony with the
laws of God and their own spirit. They heard him
gladly.</p>

<p>I wonder how he would fare to-day, when lecturers,
male or female, have to make a loud noise
to get a hearing.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Emerson’s books, prose and verse, remain with
us and still live,—“the precious life-blood of a masterspirit,
embalmed and treasured up on purpose
to a life beyond life.” That they are companionable
is proved by the way all sorts of companionable
people love them. I know a Pullman car conductor
who swears by Emerson. A young French Canadian
woodsman, (who is going to work his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
through college,) told me the other day that he
liked Emerson’s essays better than any other English
book that he had read. Restive girls and boys
of the “new generation” find something in him
which appeals to them; reading farmers of New
England and the West prefer him to Plato; even
academic professors and politicians qualifying for
statesmen feel his stimulating and liberating influence,
although (or perhaps because) he sometimes
says such hard things about them. I guess that
nothing yet written in America is likely to live
longer than Emerson’s best work.</p>

<p>His prose is better known and more admired than
his verse, for several reasons: first, because he took
more pains to make the form of it as perfect as he
could; second, because it has a wider range and an
easier utterance; third, because it has more touches
of wit and of familiarity with the daily doings of
men; and finally, because the majority of readers
probably prefer prose for silent reading, since the
full charm of good verse is revealed only in reading
aloud.</p>

<p>But for all that, with Emerson, (as with a writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
so different as Matthew Arnold,) I find something
in the poems which is not in the essays,—a more
pure and subtle essence of what is deepest in the
man. Poetry has a power of compression which is
beyond prose. It says less and suggests more.</p>

<p>Emerson wrote to the girl whom he afterwards
married: “I am born a poet,—of a low class without
doubt, but a poet.... My singing, to be sure, is
very husky and is for the most part in prose. Still
I am a poet in the sense of a perceiver and dear lover
of the harmonies that are in the soul and in matter,
and specially of the correspondence between them.”
This is penetrating self-criticism. That he was “of
a low class” as poet is more than doubtful,—an
error of modesty. But that his singing was often
“husky” cannot be denied. He never troubled
himself to learn the art of song. The music of
verse, in which Longfellow gained such mastery,
and Lowell and Whittier had such native gifts, is
not often found in Emerson’s poetry. His measures
rarely flow with freedom and harmony. They
are alternately stiff and spasmodic, and the rhymes
are sometimes threadbare, sometimes eccentric.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
Many of his poems are so condensed, so tight-packed
with thought and information that they
seem to labour along like an overladen boat in a
choppy sea. For example, this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The journeying atoms,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Primordial wholes,</div>
<div class="verse">Firmly draw, firmly drive,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">By their animate poles.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Puny man and scentless rose</div>
<div class="verse">Tormenting Pan to double the dose.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But for these defects of form Emerson as poet
makes ample amends by the richness and accuracy
of his observation of nature, by the vigorous flight
of his imagination, by the depth and at times the
passionate controlled intensity of his feeling. Of
love-poetry he has none, except the philosophical.
Of narrative poetry he has practically none, unless
you count such brief, vivid touches as,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“By the rude bridge that arched the flood,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Their flag to April’s breeze unfurled,</div>
<div class="verse">Here once the embattled farmers stood,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And fired the shot heard round the world.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But his descriptive pieces are of a rare beauty and
charm, truthful in broad outline and delicate detail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
every flower and every bird in its right colour and
place. Walking with him you see and breathe New
England in the light of early morn, with the dew
sparkling on the grass and all the cosmic forces
working underneath it. His reflective and symbolic
poems, like <cite>Each and All</cite>, <cite>The Problem</cite>, <cite>Forerunners</cite>,
<cite>Days</cite>, <cite>The Sphinx</cite>, are full of a searching and daring
imaginative power. He has also the genius of the
perfect phrase.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>His <cite>Threnody</cite>, written after the early death of his
first-born son, has always seemed to me one of the
most moving elegies in the English tongue. His
patriotic poems, especially the <cite>Concord Ode</cite>, are unsurpassed
as brief, lyrical utterances of the spirit of
America. In certain moods, when the mind is in
vigour and the windows of far vision open at a touch,
Emerson’s small volume of <cite>Poems</cite> is a most companionable
book.</p>

<p class="tb">As his prose sometimes intrudes into his verse
and checks its flow, so his poetry often runs over into
his prose and illuminates it. What could be more
poetic in conception than this sentence from his
first book, <cite>Nature</cite>? “If the stars should appear but
one night in a thousand years, how would men believe
and adore and preserve for many generations
the remembrance of the city of God which had been
shown!”</p>

<p>Emerson’s <cite>Essays</cite> are a distillation of his lectures.
His way of making these was singular and all his
own. It was his habit to keep note-books in which
he jotted down bits of observation about nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
stray thoughts and comparisons, reflections on his
reading, and striking phrases which came to him in
meditation or talk. Choosing a subject he planted
it in his mind and waited for ideas and illustrations
to come to it, as birds or insects to a flower. When
a thought appeared he followed it, “as a boy might
hunt a butterfly,” and when it was captured he
pinned it in his “thought-book.” No doubt there
were mental laws at work all the time, giving guidance
and direction to the process of composition
which seemed so irregular and haphazard. There is
no lack of vital unity in one of Emerson’s lectures
or essays. It deals with a single subject and never
gets really out of sight of the proposition with which
it begins. Yet it seldom gives a complete, all-round
view of it. It is more like a series of swift and vivid
glimpses of the same object seen from different
stand-points, a collection of snap-shot pictures taken
in the course of a walk around some great mountain.</p>

<p>From the pages of his note-books he gathered the
material for one of his lectures, selecting and arranging
it under some such title as Fate, Genius, Beauty,
Manners, Duty, The Anglo-Saxon, The Young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
American, and giving it such form and order as he
thought would be most effective in delivery. If the
lecture was often repeated, (as it usually was,) the
material was frequently rearranged, the pages were
shifted, the illustrations changed. Then, after it
had served its purpose, the material was again rearranged
and published in a volume of <cite>Essays</cite>.</p>

<p>It is easy to trace in the essays the effects of this
method of writing. The material is drawn from a
wide range of reading and observation. Emerson is
especially fond of poetry, philosophy and books of
anecdote and biography. He quotes from Shakespeare,
Dante, Goethe, George Herbert, Wordsworth,
Plutarch, Grimm, St. Simon, Swedenborg,
Behmen the mystic, Plato, and the religious books
of the East. His illustrations come from far and
near. Now they are strange and remote, now
homely and familiar. The Zodiac of Denderah; the
Savoyards who carved their pine-forests into toys;
the <i lang="la">lustrum</i> of silence which Pythagoras made his
disciples keep; Napoleon on the <i>Bellerophon</i> watching
the drill of the English soldiers; the Egyptian
legend that every man has two pair of eyes; Empedocles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
and his shoe; the flat strata of the earth; a
soft mushroom pushing up through the hard ground;—all
these allusions and a hundred more are found
in the same volume. On his pages, close beside the
Parthenon, St. Paul’s, the Sphinx, Ætna and Vesuvius,
you will read of the White Mountains, Monadnock,
Katahdin, the pickerel-weed in bloom, the
wild geese honking across the sky, the chickadee
singing in the face of winter, the Boston State-house,
Wall Street, cotton-mills, railroads, Quincy granite,
and so forth. Nothing is too far away to seem real
to him, nothing too near to seem interesting and
valuable. There is an abundance, sometimes a
superabundance, of material in his essays, not always
well-assorted, but all vivid and suggestive.</p>

<p>The structure of the essay, the way of putting the
material together, does not follow any fixed rule or
system. Yet in most cases it has a well-considered
and suitable form; it stands up; it is architecturally
built, though the art is concealed. I once amused
myself trying to analyze some of the essays, and
found that many of the best ones have a definite
theme, like a text, and follow a regular plan of development,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
with introduction, discussion, and conclusion.
In some cases Emerson does not disdain
the “heads and horns” of the old-fashioned preacher,
and numbers his points “first,” “second,” “third,”—perhaps
even “fourth.” But this is rare. For
the most part the essays do not seem to be constructed
but to grow. They are like conversations
with the stupid things left out. They turn aside
from dull points, and omit connecting links, and
follow an attractive idea wherever it may lead.
They seldom exhaust a subject, but they usually
illuminate it.</p>

<p>“The style is the man,” and in this case it is well
suited to his material and his method. It is brilliant,
sparkling, gem-like. He has great freedom in
the choice of words, using them sometimes in odd
ways and not always correctly. Generally his diction
is made up of terse, pungent Anglo-Saxon
phrases, but now and then he likes to bring in a
stately word of Greek or Latin origin, with a telling
effect of contrast. Most of his sentences are short
and clear; it is only in the paragraph that he is
sometimes cloudy. Every essay is rich in epigrams.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
If one reads too much of a style like this, the effect
becomes fatiguing. You miss the long, full, steady
flow of sentences with varied cadence and changing
music.</p>

<p>Emerson’s river is almost all rapids. The flash
and sparkle of phrase after phrase tire me after a
while. But for a short voyage nothing could be
more animated and stimulating. I read one essay
at a time and rise refreshed.</p>

<p>But the secret of Emerson’s power, (to change
the figure,) is in the wine which he offers, not the
cup into which he pours it. His great word,—“self-reliance,”—runs
through all his writing and pervades
all that he says. At times it is put in an extreme
form, and might lead, if rashly followed, to
intellectual conceit and folly. But it is balanced
by other words, no less potent,—self-criticism, modesty,
consideration, prudence, and reverence. He
is an aspiring, hopeful teacher of youth; correcting
follies with a sharp wit; encouraging noble ambitions;
making the face of nature luminous with the
glow of poetic imagination; and elevating life with
an ideal patriotism and a broad humanity. In all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
his writing one feels the serene, lofty influence of a
sane and chastened optimism, the faith which holds,
amid many appearances which are dark, mysterious
and terrifying, that Good is stronger than Evil and
will triumph at last everywhere.</p>

<p>Read what he says in the essay called <cite>Compensation</cite>:
“There is no penalty to virtue; no penalty to
wisdom; they are proper additions of being. In a
virtuous action I properly <em>am</em>; in a virtuous act I
add to the world; I plant into deserts conquered
from Chaos and Nothing, and see the darkness receding
on the limits of the horizon. There can be
no excess to love, none to knowledge, none to beauty,
when these attributes are considered in the purest
sense. The soul refuses limits, and always affirms
an Optimism, never a Pessimism.”</p>

<p>This is the note that brings a brave joy to the
ear of youth. Old age gladly listens to the same
note in the deeper, quieter music of Emerson’s poem,
<cite>Terminus</cite>.</p>

<p>Thus gallantly he appears in my mind’s eye when
I pause in rereading one of his books and summon
up a fantasm of the author,—Robert Louis Stevenson,
gentleman adventurer in life and letters, his
brown eyes shining in a swarthy face, his lean, long-enduring
body adorned with a black-velvet jacket.</p>

<p>This garment is no disguise but a symbol. It is
short, so as not to impede him with entangling tails.
It is unconventional, as a protest against the tyranny
of fashion. But it is of velvet, mark you, to match
a certain niceness of choice and preference of beauty,—yes,
and probably a touch of bravura,—in all its
wearer’s vagaries. ’Tis like the silver spurs, broad
sombrero and gay handkerchief of the thoroughbred
cowboy,—not an element of the dandiacal, but a
tribute to romance. Strange that the most genuine
of men usually have a bit of this in their composition;
your only incurable <i lang="fr">poseur</i> being the fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
who affects never to pose and betrays himself by
his attitude of scorn.</p>

<p>Of course, Stevenson did not always wear this
symbolic garment. In fact the only time I met
him in the flesh his clothes had a discouraging resemblance
to those of the rest of us at the Authors
Club in New York. And a few months ago, when
I traced his “footprints on the sands of time” at
Waikiki beach, near Honolulu, the picture drawn
for me by those who knew him when he passed that
way, was that of a lank, bare-footed, bright-eyed,
sun-browned man who daundered along the shore
in white-duck trousers and a shirt wide open at the
neck. But the velvet jacket was in his wardrobe,
you may be sure, ready for fitting weather and occasion.
He wore it, very likely, when he went to
beard the Honolulu colourman who was trying to
“do” his stepson-in-law in the matter of a bill for
paints. He put it on when he banqueted with his
amiable but bibulous friend, King Kalakaua. You
can follow it through many, if not most, of the photographs
which he had taken from his twentieth to
his forty-fourth, and last, year. And in his style<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
you can almost always feel it,—the touch of distinction,
the ease of a native elegance, the assurance
of a well-born wanderer,—in short, the velvet
jacket.</p>

<p class="caption">ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
<p class="caption-copy"><i>From a photograph, negative of which is owned by Charles Scribner’s Sons.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson began the adventure
of life in a decent little house in Howard
Place, Edinburgh, on November 13, 1850. He
completed it on the Samoan island of Upolu in the
South Seas, December 3, 1894,—completed it, I
think, for though he left his work unfinished he
had arrived at the port of honour and the haven
of happy rest.</p>

<p>His father, and his father’s father, were engineers
connected with the Board of Northern Lights. This
sounds like being related to the Aurora Borealis;
and indeed there was something of mystery and
magic about Stevenson, as if an influence from that
strange midnight dawn had entered his blood. But
as a matter of fact the family occupation was nothing
more uncanny than that of building and maintaining
lighthouses and beacons along the Scottish
coast, a profession in which they won considerable
renown and to which the lad himself was originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
assigned. He made a fair try at it, and even won
a silver medal for an essay on improvements in
lighthouses. But the calling did not suit him, and
he said afterward that he gained little from it except
“properties for some possible romance, or
words to add to my vocabulary.”</p>

<p>This lanky, queer, delicate, headstrong boy was
a dreamer of dreams, and from youth desperately
fond of writing. He felt himself a predestinated
author, and like a true Scot toiled diligently to make
his calling and election sure.</p>

<p>But there was one thing for which he cared more
than for writing, and that was living. He plunged
into it eagerly, with more zest than wisdom, trying
all the games that cities offer, and learning some
rather disenchanting lessons at a high price. For
in truth neither his physical, nor (as he later discovered)
his moral, nature was suited to the sowing
of wild oats. His constitution was one of the frailest
ever exposed to the biting winds and soaking mists
of the North British Boston. Early death seemed
to be written in his horoscope. But an indomitable
spirit laughs at dismal predictions. Robert Louis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Stevenson, (as he now called himself, velvet-jacketing
his own name,) was not the man to be easily
snuffed out by weak lungs or wild weather. Mocking
at “bloody Jack” he held fast to life with grim,
cheerful, grotesque courage; his mother, his wife,
his trusty friends, heartened him for the combat;
and he succeeded in having a wider experience and
doing more work than falls to the lot of many men
in rudely exuberant health. To do this calls for a
singular kind of bravery, not inferior to, nor unlike,
that of the good soldier who walks with Death undismayed.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Stevenson was born with a <i lang="de">Wanderlust</i>.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“My mistress was the open road</div>
<div class="verse">And the bright eyes of danger.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ill health gave occasion and direction to many
voyages and experiments, some of which bettered
him, while others made him worse. As a bachelor
he roamed mountains afoot and travelled rivers in
his own boat, explored the purlieus and sublittorals
of Paris, London, and Edinburgh, lodged “on the
seacoast of Bohemia,” crossed the ocean as an emigrant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
and made himself vagrantly at home in California
where he married the wife “the great Artificer
made for him.” They passed their honeymoon in
a deserted miner’s cabin, and then lived around, in
Scotland, the Engadine, Southern France, Bournemouth,
the Adirondacks, and on a schooner among
the South Sea Islands, bringing up at last in the
pleasant haven of Vailima. On all these distant
roads Death pursued him, and, till the last ten years,
Poverty was his companion. Yet he looked with
keen and joyful eyes upon the changing face of the
world and into its shadowy heart without trembling.
He kept his spirit unbroken, his faith unquenched
even when the lights burned low. He
counted life</p>

<div class="verse indent15">“just a stuff</div>
<div class="verse">To try the soul’s strength on and educe the man.”</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He may have stumbled and sometimes fallen, things
may have looked black to him; but he never gave
up, and in spite of frailties and burdens, he travelled
a long way,—upward. Through all his travels and
tribulations he kept on writing, writing, writing,—the
very type of a migratory author. He made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
first appearance in a canoe. The log of this journey,
<cite>An Inland Voyage on French Rivers</cite>, published in
1878, was a modest, whimsical, charming début in
literature. In 1879 he appeared again, and this
time with a quaint companion. <cite>Travels with a Donkey
in the Cevennes</cite> is one of the most delightful,
uninstructive descriptions of a journey ever written
in English. It contains no practical information
but plenty of pleasure and profit. I do not envy
the reader who can finish it without loving that
obstinate little mouse-coloured Modestine, and feeling
that she is one of the best-drawn female characters,
of her race, in fiction.</p>

<p>From this good, quiet beginning his books followed
rapidly, and (after <cite>Treasure Island</cite>, that incomparable
boys’ book for men,) with growing popularity
among the judicious, the “gentle readers,”
who choose books not because they are recommended
by professors or advertised in department stores,
but because they are really well written and worth
reading.</p>

<p>It is difficult to classify Stevenson’s books, perhaps
just because they are migrants, borderers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Yet I think a rough grouping, at least of his significant
works, may be made. There are five volumes
of travels; six or seven volumes of short stories;
nine longer novels or romances; three books of verse;
three books of essays; one biography; and one
study of South Sea politics. This long list lights
up two vital points in the man: his industry and
his versatility.</p>

<p>“A virtue and a vice,” say you? Well, that may
be as you choose to take it, reader. But if you say
it in a sour or a puritanical spirit, Stevenson will
gaily contradict you, making light of what you
praise and vaunting what you blame.</p>

<p>Industry? Nonsense! Did he not write <cite>An
Apology for Idlers</cite>? Yet unquestionably he was a
toiler; his record proves it. Fleeing from one land
to another to shake off his implacable enemy; camping
briefly in strange places; often laid on his back
by sickness and sometimes told to “move on” by
Policeman Penury; collecting his books by post and
correcting his proofs in bed; he made out to produce
twenty-nine volumes in sixteen years,—say
8,000 pages of 300 words, each,—a thing manifestly
impossible without a mort of work. But of this he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
thought less than of the fact that he did it, as a
rule, cheerfully and with a high heart. Herein he
came near to his own ideal of success: “To be
honest, to be kind—to earn a little and to spend a
little less, to make upon the whole a family happier
for his presence, to renounce when that shall be
necessary and not to be embittered, to keep a few
friends, but these without capitulation,—above all,
on the same grim condition, to keep friends with
himself—here is a task for all that a man has of
fortitude and delicacy.” Of his work I think he
would have said that he stuck to it, first, because
he needed the money that it brought in, and second,
because he enjoyed it exceedingly. With this he
would have smiled away the puritan who wished
to pat him on the back for industry.</p>

<p>That he was versatile, turned from one subject
to another, tried many forms of his art, and succeeded
in some better than in others, he would have
admitted boldly—even before those critics who
speak slightingly of versatility as if it marked some
inferiority in a writer, whereas they dislike it chiefly
because it gives them extra trouble in putting him
into his precise pigeonhole of classification. Stevenson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
would have referred these gentlemen to his masters
Scott and Thackeray for a justification. His
versatility was not that of a weathercock whirled
about by every wind of literary fashion, but that of
a well-mounted gun which can be turned towards
any mark. He did not think that because he had
struck a rich vein of prose story-telling he must
follow that lead until he had worked it or himself
out. He was a prospector as well as a miner. He
wished to roam around, to explore things, books,
and men, to see life vividly as it is, and then to write
what he thought of it in any form that seemed to
him fit,—essay, or story, or verse. And this he did,
thank God, without misgiving, and on the whole
greatly to our benefit and enjoyment.</p>

<p>I am writing now of the things which make his
books companionable. That is why I have begun
with a thumb-nail sketch of the man in the velvet
jacket who lives in them and in his four volumes of
letters,—the best English letters, it seems to me,
since Lamb and Thackeray. That also is why I
have not cared to interrupt this simple essay by
telling which of his works strike me as comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
failures, and giving more or less convincing reasons
why certain volumes in my “collective edition” are
less worn than others.</p>

<p>’Tis of these others that I wish to speak,—the
volumes whose bindings are like a comfortable suit
of old clothes and on whose pages there are pencil-marks
like lovers’ initials cut upon the bark of
friendly trees. What charm keeps them alive and
fresh, in an age when most books five years old are
considered out of date and everything from the unspacious
times of Queen Victoria is cordially
damned? What manner of virility is in them to
evoke, and to survive, such a flood of “Stevensoniana”?
What qualities make them still welcome
to so wide a range of readers, young and old,
simple and learned,—yes, even among that fair
and capricious sex whose claim to be courted his
earlier writings seem so lightly (or prudently) to
neglect?</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Over and above the attraction of his pervading
personality, I think the most obvious charm of
Stevenson’s books lies in the clear, vivid, accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
and strong English in which they are written. Reading
them is like watching a good golfer drive or putt
the ball with clean strokes in which energy is never
wanting and never wasted. He does not foozle, or
lose his temper in a hazard, or brandish his brassy
like a war-club. There is a grace of freedom in his
play which comes from practice and self-control.</p>

<p>Stevenson describes (as far as such a thing is
possible) the way in which he got his style. “All
through my boyhood and youth,” says he, “I was
known and pointed out for the pattern of an idler,
and yet I was always busy on my own private end,
which was to learn to write.” He traces with gusto,
and doubtless with as much accuracy as can be
expected in a map drawn from memory, the trails
of early admiration which he followed towards this
goal. His list of “authors whom I have imitated”
is most entertaining: Hazlitt, Lamb, Wordsworth,
Sir Thomas Browne, Defoe, Hawthorne, Montaigne,
Baudelaire, Obermann. In another essay, on
“Books Which Have Influenced Me,” he names
<cite>The Bible</cite>, <cite>Hamlet</cite>, <cite>As You Like It</cite>, <cite>King Lear</cite>, <cite>Le
Vicomte de Bragelonne</cite>, <cite>The Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>, <cite>Leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
of Grass</cite>, Herbert Spencer’s books, Lewes’s <cite>Life of
Goethe</cite>, the <cite>Meditations</cite> of Marcus Aurelius, the
poems of Wordsworth, George Meredith’s <cite>The
Egoist</cite>, the essays of Thoreau and Hazlitt, Mitford’s
<cite>Tales of Old Japan</cite>,—a strange catalogue,
but not incoherent if you remember that he is speaking
now more of their effect upon his way of thinking
than of their guidance in his manner of writing,—though
in this also I reckon he learned something
from them, especially from the English Bible.</p>

<p>Besides the books which he read, he carried about
with him little blank-books in which he jotted down
the noteworthy in what he saw, heard, or imagined.
He learned also from penless authors, composers
without a manuscript, masters of the <i lang="la">viva-voce</i> style,
like Robert, the Scotch gardener, and John Todd,
the shepherd. When he saw a beggar on horseback,
he cared not where the horse came from, he watched
the rascal ride. If an expression struck him “for
some conspicuous force, some happy distinction,”
he promptly annexed it;—because he understood
it, it was his.</p>

<p>In two separate essays, each of which he calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
“A Gossip,” he pays tribute to “the bracing influence
of old Dumas,” and to the sweeping power
and broad charm of Walter Scott, “a great romantic—an
idle child,” the type of easy writers. But
Stevenson is of a totally different type, though of
a kindred spirit. He is the best example in modern
English of a careful writer. He modelled and remodelled,
touched and retouched his work, toiled
tremendously. The chapter on Honolulu in <cite>The
Wrecker</cite>, was rewritten ten times. His essays for
<cite>Scribner’s Magazine</cite> passed through half a dozen
revisions.</p>

<p>His end in view was to bring his language closer
to life, not to use the common language of life.
That, he maintained, was too diffuse, too indiscriminate.
He wished to condense, to distil, to
bring out the real vitality of language. He was
like <cite>Sentimental Tommy</cite> in Barrie’s book, willing
to cogitate three hours to find the solitary word
which would make the thing he had in mind stand
out distinct and unmistakable. What matter if
his delay to finish his paper lost him the prize in
the competition? Tommy’s prize was the word;
when he had that his work was crowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>A willingness to be content with the wrong colour,
to put up with the word which does not fit, is the
mark of inferior work. For example, the author of
<cite>Trilby</cite>, wishing to describe a certain quick, retentive
look, speaks of the painter’s “<em>prehensile</em> eye.” The
adjective startles, but does not illuminate. The
prehensile quality belongs to tails rather than to
eyes.</p>

<p>There is a modern school of writers fondly given
to the cross-breeding of adjectives and nouns. Their
idea of a vivid style is satisfied by taking a subject
which belongs to one region of life and describing
it in terms drawn from another. Thus if they write
of music, they use the language of painting; if of
painting, they employ the terminology of music.
They give us pink songs of love, purple roars of
anger, and gray dirges of despair. Or they describe
the andante passages of a landscape, and the minor
key of a heroine’s face.</p>

<p>This is the extravagance of a would-be pointed
style which mistakes the incongruous for the brilliant.
Stevenson may have had something to do
with the effort to escape from the polished commonplace
of an English which admitted no master earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
than Addison or later than Macaulay. He may
have been a leader in the hunting of the unexpected,
striking, pungent word. But for the excesses and
absurdities of this school of writing in its decadence,
he had no liking. He knew that if you are going
to use striking words you must be all the more careful
to make them hit the mark.</p>

<p>He sets forth his theory of style in the essay called
<cite>A Humble Remonstrance</cite>. It amounts to this: First,
you shall have an idea, a controlling thought; then
you shall set your words and sentences marching
after it as soldiers follow their captain; and if any
turns back, looks the other way, fails to keep step,
you shall put him out of the ranks as a malingerer,
a deserter at heart. “The proper method of literature,”
says he, “is by selection, which is a kind of
negative exaggeration.” But the positive exaggeration,—the
forced epithet, the violent phrase,
the hysterical paragraph,—he does not allow.
Hence we feel at once a restraint and an intensity,
a poignancy and a delicacy in his style, which make
it vivid without ever becoming insane even when
he describes insanity, as he does in <cite>The Merry Men</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
<cite>Olalla</cite>, and <cite>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</cite>. His words
are focussed on the object as with a burning-glass.
They light it up; they kindle it; but they do not
distort it.</p>

<p>Now a style like this may have its occasional
fatigues: it may convey a sense of over-carefulness,
of a choice somewhat too meticulous,—to use a
word which in itself illustrates my meaning. But
after all it has a certain charm, especially in these
days of slipshod, straddling English. You like to
see a man put his foot down in the right place,
neither stumbling nor swaggering. The assurance
with which he treads may be the result of forethought
and concentration, but to you, reading,
it gives a feeling of ease and confidence. You follow
him with pleasure because he knows where he
is going and has taken pains to study the best way
of getting there.</p>

<p>Take a couple of illustrations from the early
sketches which Stevenson wrote to accompany a
book of etchings of Edinburgh,—hack work, you
may call them; but even hack work can be done
with a nice conscience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is the Edinburgh climate: “The weather is
raw and boisterous in winter, shifty and ungenial
in summer, and a downright meteorological purgatory
in spring. The delicate die early, and I, as a
survivor among bleak winds and plumping rains,
have been sometimes tempted to envy them their
fate.”</p>

<p>Here is the Scottish love of home: (One of the
tall “lands,” inhabited by a hundred families, has
crumbled and gone down.) “How many people
all over the world, in London, Canada, New Zealand,
could say with truth, ‘The house I was born
in fell last night’!”</p>

<p>Now turn to a volume of short stories. Here is
a Hebridean night, in <cite>The Merry Men</cite>: “Outside
was a wonderful clear night of stars, with here and
there a cloud still hanging, last stragglers of the
tempest. It was near the top of the flood, and the
Merry Men were roaring in the windless quiet.”</p>

<p>Here is a sirocco in Spain: “It came out of malarious
lowlands, and over several snowy sierras.
The nerves of those on whom it blew were strung
and jangled; their eyes smarted with the dust;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
their legs ached under the burden of their body;
and the touch of one hand upon another grew to
be odious.”</p>

<p>Now take an illustration from one of his very
early essays, <cite>Notes on the Movements of Young Children</cite>,
printed in 1874. Here are two very little girls
learning to dance: “In these two, particularly, the
rhythm was sometimes broken by an excess of
energy, <em>as though the pleasure of the music in their
light bodies could endure no longer the restraint of the
regulated dance</em>.”</p>

<p>These examples are purposely chosen from tranquil
pages; there is nothing far-fetched or extraordinary
about them; yet I shall be sorry for you,
reader, if you do not feel something rare and precious
in a style like this, in which the object, however
simple, is made alive with a touch, and stands before
you as if you saw it for the first time.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Tusitala,—“Teller of Tales,”—was the name
which the South Sea Islanders gave to Stevenson;
and he liked it well. Beginning as an essayist, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
turned more and more, as his life went on, to
the art of prose fiction as that in which he most
desired to excel. It was in this field, indeed, that
he made his greatest advance. His later essays do
not surpass his earlier ones as much as his later
stories excel his first attempts.</p>

<p>Here I conceive my reader objecting: Did not
<cite>Treasure Island</cite> strike twelve early in the day? Is
it not the best book of its kind in English?</p>

<p>Yes, my fellow Stevensonian, it is all that you
say, and more,—of its kind it has no superior, so
far as I know, in any language. But the man who
wrote it wrote also books of a better kind,—deeper,
broader, more significant, and in writing these he
showed, in spite of some relapses, a steadily growing
power which promised to place him in the very
highest rank of English novelists.</p>

<p><cite>The Master of Ballantrae</cite>, maugre its defects of
construction, has the inevitable atmosphere of fate,
and the unforgettable figures of the two brothers,
born rivals. The second part of <cite>David Balfour</cite> is
not only a better romance, but also a better piece
of character drawing, than the first part. <cite>St. Ives</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
which was left unfinished, may have been little
more than a regular “sword-and-cloak” story, more
choicely written, perhaps, than is usual among the
followers of “old Dumas.” But Stevenson’s other
unfinished book, <cite>Weir of Hermiston</cite>, is the torso of
a mighty and memorable work of art. It has the
lines and the texture of something great.</p>

<p>Why, then, was it not finished? Ask Death.</p>

<p><cite>Lorna Doone</cite> was written at forty-four years:
<cite>The Scarlet Letter</cite> at forty-six: <cite>The Egoist</cite> at fifty-one:
<cite>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</cite> at fifty-one. Stevenson
died at forty-four. But considerations of what
he might have done, (and disputes about the insoluble
question,) should not hinder us from appraising
his actual work as a teller of tales which
do not lose their interest nor their charm.</p>

<p>He had a theory of the art of narration which he
stated from time to time with considerable definiteness
and inconsiderable variations. It is not obligatory
to believe that his stories were written on
this theory. It is more likely that he did the work
first as he wanted to do it, and then, like a true
Scot, reasoned out an explanation of why he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
done it in just that way. But even so, his theory
remains good as a comment on the things that he
liked best in his own stories. Let us take it briefly.</p>

<p>His first point is that fiction does not, and can
not, compete with real life. Life has a vastly more
varied interest because it is more complex. Fiction
must not try to reproduce this complexity
literally, for that is manifestly impossible. What
the novelist has to do is to turn deliberately the
other way, and seek to hold you by simplifying and
clarifying the material Which life presents. He wins
not by trying to tell you everything, but by telling
you that which means most in the revelation of
character and in the unfolding of the story. Of
necessity he can deal only with a part of life, and
that chiefly on the dramatic side, the dream side;
for a life in which the ordinary, indispensable details
of mere existence are omitted is, after all, more
or less dream-like. Therefore, the story-teller must
renounce the notion of making his story a literal
transcript of even a single day of actual life, and
concentrate his attention upon those things which
seem to him the most real in life,—the things that
count.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>Now a man who takes this view of fiction, if he
excels at all, will be sure to do so in the short story,
a form in which the art of omission is at a high premium.
Here, it seems to me, Stevenson is a master
unsurpassed. <cite>Will o’ the Mill</cite> is a perfect idyl;
<cite>Markheim</cite>, a psychological tale in Hawthorne’s
manner; <cite>Olalla</cite>, a love-story of tragic beauty; and
<cite>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</cite>, in spite of its obvious
moving-picture artifice, a parable of intense power.</p>

<p>Stevenson said to Graham Balfour: “There are
three ways of writing a story. You may take a
plot and fit characters to it, or you may take a character
and choose incidents and situations to develop
it, or lastly you may take a certain atmosphere and
get actions and persons to express and realize it.
I’ll give you an example—<cite>The Merry Men</cite>. There
I began with the feeling of one of those islands on
the west coast of Scotland, and I gradually developed
the feeling with which that coast affected
me.” This, probably, is somewhat the way in which
Hawthorne wrote <cite>The House of the Seven Gables</cite>;
yet I do not think that is one of his best romances,
any more than I think <cite>The Merry Men</cite> one of Stevenson’s
best short stories. It is not memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
as a tale. Only the bits of description live. <cite>The
Treasure of Franchard</cite>, light and airy as it is, has
more of that kind of reality which Stevenson sought.
Therefore it seems as if his third “way of writing
a story” were not the best suited to his genius.</p>

<p>The second way,—that in which the plot links and
unfolds the characters,—is the path on which he
shows at his best. Here the gentleman adventurer
was at ease from the moment he set forth on it.
In <cite>Treasure Island</cite> he raised the dime novel to the
level of a classic.</p>

<p>It has been charged against Stevenson’s stories
that there are no women in them. To this charge
one might enter what the lawyers call a plea of “confession
and avoidance.” Even were it true, it would
not necessarily be fatal. It may well be doubted
whether that primitive factor which psychologists
call “sex-interest” plays quite such a predominant,
perpetual, and all-absorbing part in real life as that
which neurotic writers assign to it in their books.
But such a technical, (and it must be confessed,
somewhat perilous,) defense is not needed. There
are plenty of women in Stevenson’s books,—quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
as many, and quite as delightful and important as
you will find in the ordinary run of life. Marjory
in <cite>Will o’ the Mill</cite> is more lovable than Will himself.
Olalla is the true heroine of the story which
bears her name. Catriona and Miss Grant, in the
second part of <cite>David Balfour</cite>, are girls of whom it
would be an honour to be enamoured; and I make
no doubt that David, (like Stevenson) was hard
put to it to choose between them. Uma, in <cite>The
Beach of Falesa</cite>, is a lovely insulated Eve. The two
Kirsties, in <cite>Weir of Hermiston</cite>, are creatures of intense
and vivid womanhood. It would have been
quite impossible for a writer who had such a mother
as Stevenson’s, such a friend of youth as Mrs. Sitwell,
such a wife as Margaret Vandegrift, to ignore
or slight the part which woman plays in human
life. If he touches it with a certain respect and
<i lang="la">pudor</i>, that also is in keeping with his character,—the
velvet jacket again.</p>

<p>The second point in his theory of fiction is that
in a well-told tale the threads of narrative should
converge, now and then, in a scene which expresses,
visibly and unforgettably, the very soul of the story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
He instances Robinson Crusoe finding the footprint
on the beach, and the Pilgrim running from
the City of Destruction with his fingers in his ears.</p>

<p>There are many of these flash-of-lightning scenes
in Stevenson’s stories. The duel in <cite>The Master of
Ballantrae</cite> where the brothers face each other in
the breathless winter midnight by the light of unwavering
candles, and Mr. Henry cries to his tormentor,
“I will give you every advantage, for I
think you are about to die.” The flight across the
heather, in <cite>Kidnapped</cite>, when Davie lies down, forspent,
and Alan Breck says, “Very well then, I’ll
carry ye”; whereupon Davie looks at the little
man and springs up ashamed, crying “Lead on,
I’ll follow!” The moment in <cite>Olalla</cite> when the Englishman
comes to the beautiful Spanish mistress of
the house with his bleeding hand to be bound up,
and she, catching it swiftly to her lips, bites it to
the bone. The dead form of Israel Hands lying huddled
together on the clean, bright sand at the bottom
of the lagoon of <cite>Treasure Island</cite>. Such pictures
imprint themselves on memory like seals.</p>

<p>The third point in Stevenson’s theory is, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
details should be reduced to a minimum in number
and raised to a maximum in significance. He wrote
to Henry James, (and the address of the letter is
amusing,) “How to escape from the besotting <em>particularity</em>
of fiction? ‘Roland approached the house;
it had green doors and window blinds; and there
was a scraper on the upper step.’ To hell with Roland
and the scraper!” Many a pious reader would
say “thank you” for this accurate expression of his
sentiments.</p>

<p>But when Stevenson sets a detail in a story you
see at once that it cannot be spared. Will o’ the
Mill, throwing back his head and shouting aloud
to the stars, seems to see “a momentary shock
among them, and a diffusion of frosty light pass
from one to another along the sky.” When Markheim
has killed the antiquarian and stands in the
old curiosity shop, musing on the eternity of a moment’s
deed,—“first one and then another, with
every variety of pace and voice,—one deep as the
bell from a cathedral turret, another ringing on its
treble notes the prelude of a waltz,—the clocks began
to strike the hour of three in the afternoon.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Turning over the bit of paper on which “the black
spot,” the death-notice of the pirates, has been
scrawled with charcoal, Jim Hawkins finds it has
been cut from the last page of a Bible, and on the
other side he reads part of a verse from the last
chapter of the Revelation: <em>Without are dogs and
murderers</em>.</p>

<p>There is no “besotting particularity” in such details
as these. On the contrary they illustrate the
classic conception of a work of art, in which every
particular must be vitally connected with the general,
and the perfection of the smallest part depends
upon its relation to the perfect whole. Now this
is precisely the quality, and the charm, of Stevenson’s
stories, short or long. He omits the non-essential,
but his eye never misses the significant. He
does not waste your time and his own in describing
the coloured lights in the window of a chemist’s shop
where nothing is to happen, or the quaint costume
of a disagreeable woman who has no real part in
the story. That kind of realism, of local colour, does
not interest him. But he is careful to let you know
that Alan Breck wore a sword that was much too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
long for him; that Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish,
gave an impression of deformity without any nameable
malformation, and bore himself “with a sort
of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness”;
that John Silver could use his wooden leg as a terrible
weapon; that the kitchen of the cottage on
Aros was crammed with rare incongruous treasures
from far away; and that on a certain cold sunny
morning “the blackbirds sung exceeding sweet and
loud about the House of Durisdeer, and there was
a noise of the sea in all the chambers.” Why these
<em>trivia</em>? Why such an exact touch on these details?
Because they count.</p>

<p>Yet Stevenson’s tales and romances do not give—at
least to me—the effect of over-elaboration, of
strain, of conscious effort; there is nothing affected
and therefore nothing tedious in them. They move;
they carry you along with them; they are easy to
read; one does not wish to lay them down and take
a rest. There is artifice in them, of course, but it
is a thoroughly natural artifice,—as natural as a
clean voice and a clear enunciation are to a well-bred
gentleman. He does not think about them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
he uses them in his habit as he lives. Tusitala enjoys
his work as a teller of tales; he is at home in
it. His manner is his own; it suits him; he wears
it without fear or misgiving,—the velvet jacket
again.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Of Stevenson as a moralist I hesitate to write
because whatever is said on this point is almost
certain to be misunderstood. On one side are the
puritans who frown at a preacher in a velvet jacket;
on the other side the pagans who scoff at an artist
who cares for morals. Yet surely there is a way
between the two extremes where an artist-man
may follow his conscience with joy to deal justly,
to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God.
And having caught sight of that path, though he
may trace it but dimly and follow it stumbling,
surely such a man may say to his fellows, “This is
the good way; let us walk in it.” Not one of the
great writers who have used the English language,
so far as I know, has finished his career without
wishing to moralize, to teach something worth learning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
to stand in the pulpit of experience and give
an honest message to the world. Stevenson was
no exception to this rule. He avowed the impulse
frankly when he said to William Archer, “I would
rise from the dead to preach.”</p>

<p>In his stories we look in vain for “morals” in the
narrow sense,—proverbs printed in italics and
tagged on to the tale like imitation oranges tied to
a Christmas tree. The teaching of his fiction is
like that of life, diffused through the course of events
and embodied in the development of characters.
But as the story unfolds we are never in doubt as
to the feelings of the narrator,—his pity for the
unfortunate; his scorn for the mean, the selfish,
the hypocritical; his admiration for the brave, the
kind, the loyal and cheerful servants of duty. Never
at his lightest and gayest does he make us think of
life as a silly farce; nor at his sternest and saddest
does he leave us disheartened, “having no hope
and without God in the world.” Behind the play
there is a meaning, and beyond the conflict there
is a victory, and underneath the uncertainties of
doubt there is a foothold for faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>I like what Stevenson wrote to an old preacher,
his father’s friend. “Yes, my father was a ‘distinctly
religious man,’ but not a pious.... His
sentiments were tragic; he was a tragic thinker.
Now granted that life is tragic to the marrow, it
seems the proper service of religion to make us accept
and serve in that tragedy, as officers in that
other and comparable one of war. Service is the
word, active service in the military sense; and the
religious man—I beg pardon, the pious man—is he
who has a military joy in duty,—not he who weeps
over the wounded.”</p>

<p>This is the point of view from which Stevenson
writes as a novelist; you can feel it even in a romance
as romantic as <cite>Prince Otto</cite>; and in his essays,
where he speaks directly and in the first person,
this way of taking life as an adventure for the valourous
and faithful comes out yet more distinctly.
The grace and vigour of his diction, the pointed
quality of his style, the wit of his comment on men
and books, add to the persuasiveness of his teaching.
I can see no reason why morality should be
drab and dull. It was not so in Stevenson’s character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
nor is it so in his books. That is one reason
why they are companionable.</p>

<p>“There is nothing in it [the world],” wrote he to
a friend, “but the moral side—but the great battle
and the breathing times with their refreshments.
I see no more and no less. And if you look again,
it is not ugly, and it is filled with promise.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
